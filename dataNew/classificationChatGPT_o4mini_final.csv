703,3,"The paper investigates young people’s intentions and self-reported willingness to engage in actions that reduce PM2.5, which squarely fits into the Behaviors category because it focuses on intended or stated actions in response to air pollution rather than solely beliefs, policy preferences, health impacts, or issue prioritization.

704,0,"This study centers on how individuals perceive and understand indoor air quality (“Perceptions”), explores their reported actions and motivations to seek information or improve home air quality (“Behaviors”), and directly links these perceptions to perceived health risks from indoor air pollution (“Health”).

704,1,"This paper explores how individuals perceive and define “clean air” in their homes, focusing on sensory cues (sight, smell, temperature) and contextual conditions that shape their understanding. It also examines participants’ attitudes toward health risks of indoor air pollution and how these perceptions influence information-seeking or attempts to improve air quality. Therefore, it fits the Perceptions category (what people think and know about air pollution) and the Health category (perceptions of health risks associated with air pollution).

704,2,"The paper centers on how people perceive and understand indoor air quality—capturing sensory-based beliefs and attitudes—which clearly places it in the Perceptions category. It also examines people’s views on health risks from indoor pollution, mapping directly onto the Health category. Finally, by reporting that participants are motivated to seek information and improve their home air quality, it touches on expressed willingness to act, so it also fits under Behaviors.

704,3,"The study primarily examines how individuals perceive indoor air quality and their health risk attitudes (sensory perceptions, definitions of “clean air,” and motivations around household air pollution), which aligns with both Perceptions and Health categories.

704,4,"This paper explores how lay individuals perceive indoor air quality—through sensory cues (sight, smell, temperature), daily practices, and contextual factors—and examines their attitudes toward health risks associated with household air pollution. It thus fits both the Perceptions category (what people think and believe about air quality) and the Health category (perceptions of health risks from indoor air pollution).

705,0,"The study examines what motorists actually do—tampering with emissions controls and taking steps to “pass the test”—in response to California’s Smog Check program. This focuses on concrete behaviors related to air pollution, not perceptions, policy preferences, or health impacts.

705,1,"The paper evaluates the design and real‐world effectiveness of California’s vehicle inspection and maintenance (smog check) program, highlighting how motorists tamper with or modify their vehicles to “pass the test” and discussing policy implications for future I/M programs. This clearly falls under the Policy category.
