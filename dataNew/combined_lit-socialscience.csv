261,10.3390/app11041894,A New Indicator to Assess Public Perception of Air Pollution Based on Complaint Data,"Sun, Y; Jin, FX; Zheng, Y; Ji, M; Wang, HM",2021,APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,11.0,4,"Severe air pollution problems have led to a rise in the Chinese public's concern, and it is necessary to use monitoring stations to monitor and evaluate pollutant levels. However, monitoring stations are limited, and the public is everywhere. It is also essential to understand the public's awareness and behavioral response to air pollution. Air pollution complaint data can more directly reflect the public's real air quality perception than social media data. Therefore, based on air pollution complaint data and sentiment analysis, we proposed a new air pollution perception index (APPI) in this paper. Firstly, we constructed the emotional dictionary for air pollution and used sentiment analysis to calculate public complaints' emotional intensity. Secondly, we used the piecewise function to obtain the APPI based on the complaint Kernel density and complaint emotion Kriging interpolation, and we further analyzed the change of center of gravity of the APPI. Finally, we used the proposed APPI to examine the 2012 to 2017 air pollution complaint data in Shandong Province, China. The results were verified by the POI (points of interest) data and word cloud analysis. The results show that: (1) the statistical analysis and spatial distribution of air pollution complaint density and public complaint emotion intensity are not entirely consistent. The proposed APPI can more reasonably evaluate the public perception of air pollution. (2) The public perception of air pollution tends to the southwest of Shandong Province, while coastal cities are relatively weak. (3) The content of public complaints about air pollution mainly focuses on the exhaust emissions of enterprises. Moreover, the more enterprises gather in inland cities, the public perception of air pollution is stronger.",air pollution; public perception; sentiment analysis; Kernel density; Kriging interpolation; air pollution perception index,,QUALITY; SATISFACTION; CHINA; RISK,WOS
308,10.3390/su10061970,A Questionnaire Case Study of Chinese Opinions on the Haze Pollution and Economic Growth,"Qiu, F; Wang, E; Fan, M; Liao, H; Wang, LT; Huang, ZY",2018,SUSTAINABILITY,10.0,6,"Haze pollution in China has reshaped daily life for the Chinese and led to serious health issues. At the same time, the Chinese have enjoyed the rapid economic growth that has contributed to this pollution. While questionnaire-based studies have been conducted within certain regions of China to learn the public's opinions of haze pollution, little work has been done to understand how Chinese citizens value haze treatment in relation to their nation's economic growth at a nationwide scale. To fill this knowledge gap, this project conducted a nationwide investigation of Chinese opinions on the benefits of economic growth versus the disadvantages of haze pollution, as well as their responses to efforts by the Chinese government to combat haze and to the influence of haze on Chinese daily life and on personal health. The study also sought suggestions for combatting haze. In particular, an anonymous questionnaire consisting of 29 questions was given in the summer and fall of 2017 to 1233 people of different genders, ages, child statuses, educational backgrounds, occupations, living areas (rural, suburban, and urban), and living regions. The statistical Chi squared test was then used to identify the demographic group of respondents supporting the economic slowdown policy or requesting more efforts from the Chinese government to combat haze pollution. A multivariate statistical approachprincipal component analysiswas further applied to visualize respondents' feedback on the impact of haze on their daily life and personal health, as well as the change of environment and economic conditions in the last 10 years. The results show that more than 50% of respondents, especially those with children, those between the ages of 31 to 50, and those living in high-pollution regions, supported the economic slowdown policy. Totally 40.63% of the entire group of respondents believed the government's efforts to control haze were small or very small. Only 27.84% of respondents held the opposite opinions. In total, 72.91% of respondents believed the environment in China became worse or much worse in the past 10 years; however, most responded positively to the idea of resolving the haze issue within 15 or more years. Haze has caused health issues in and around half of the respondents and has significantly reshaped their outdoor activities.",haze pollution; statistical survey; principal component analysis; Chi squared test,China; demography; economic conditions; economic growth; economic policy; environmental economics; government; haze; pollution control; principal component analysis; public health; questionnaire survey; survey method; testing method,WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; AIR-POLLUTION; SMOG POLLUTION; PERCEPTION; CITY; COAL; EMISSIONS; IMPACTS; QUALITY,WOS
328,10.3390/su8111111,A Questionnaire Case Study to Investigate Public Awareness of Smog Pollution in China's Rural Areas,"Jiang, L; Hiltunen, E; He, XL; Zhu, LD",2016,SUSTAINABILITY,8.0,11,"Smog pollution is one of China's most pressing public health issues today and has therefore received significant attention worldwide. Not only cities but also villages in China are suffering from smog pollution, especially since 2013. However, there is limited information available about public awareness on smog pollution in China, especially for where it concerns the residents living in villages. Based on a questionnaire survey, this study aims to help fill this gap. The results of the study show that the income of the majority of respondents comes from working in the city, accounting for 31.6% of the total income. The percentages for respondents related to access to smog information from various channels are as follows: TV (28.5%), radio (24.2%), neighbors (13.5%), Internet (9.8%), newspapers (8.3%) and others (7.8%). As for attitudes regarding the severity degree and main cause of smog pollution, most respondents (33.7%) thought smog pollution in villages was somewhat severe, while 26.3% agreed that the main contributor to smog pollution was industrial emissions, followed by coal burning at power plants (20.9%) and vehicle emissions (17.7%). The results also indicate that most of the respondents were satisfied with the government's performance in terms of smog control. However, 67.9% of respondents indicated they would remain silent and not intervene when confronted by an activity that causes smog pollution. This study can help to improve an understanding of public awareness regarding smog pollution in China's rural areas and thereby activate positive public participation in smog pollution prevention and management in the search for sustainable development.",smog; public awareness; public participation; pollution; energy; governance; China,China; burning; energy market; income; industrial emission; local participation; participatory approach; performance assessment; public health; questionnaire survey; resident population; rural area; smog; state role; sustainable development; traffic emission,WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; DYNAMICS; PM2.5,WOS
303,10.3390/ijgi13100352,A Study of the Evolution of Haze Microblog Concerns Based on a Co-Word Network Analysis,Lu H.; Rui X.; Li R.; Zhang G.; Zhang Z.; Wu M.,2024,,13.0,10,"Haze is a phenomenon caused by excessive PM2.5 (air-borne particulate matter having a diameter of fewer than 2.5 μm) and other pollutants and results from the interaction between specific climatic conditions and human activities. It significantly impacts human health, transportation, and the natural environment and has aroused widespread concern. However, the influence of haze on human mental health, being hidden and indirect, is often overlooked. When haze pollution occurs, people express their feelings and concerns about haze events on media such as Weibo. At present, few studies focus on haze public opinion, as well as the changing trends in people’s discussion of haze since its emergence, which is of great significance for haze response and resource management. Based on the perspective of topic analysis, this study explores the psychological impact of haze on people by exploring the feelings of netizens in haze public opinion and investigates the evolution of people’s concerns based on long-term public opinion data. In this study, seven typical provinces and cities in China with severe haze pollution were selected as the research area. Based on data on the “haze” theme from Weibo from 2013 to 2019, first, the microblog posts were preprocessed, and the keyword co-word network was constructed. Second, the Louvain algorithm was used to detect the topic community. Based on this, the cosine similarity was calculated to realize the temporal evolution analysis of topics. The results show that with the development and change in haze pollution, the content and intensity of the topics netizens pay attention to have changed, including five types: merger, split, survival, transformation, and rebirth/extinction. People’s attention to haze shows obvious spatial differences, and it is related to the degree of haze pollution, which is bipolar. Areas with severe haze tend to pay more attention to haze itself and its influence, while areas with light haze pay more attention to haze control. The research results can provide valuable insights for governments and relevant departments in guiding public opinion and resource allocation. © 2024 by the authors.",co-word network; haze; microblog public opinion; topic evolution; topic mining; topic similarity,,,Scopus

It is emerging as a modifiable risk factor for cancer, diabetes, and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Lebanese physicians regarding air pollution. Methods: This observational study uses a descriptive cross-sectional correlational design. The data were collected using a self-administered online survey that was sent to 874 potential respondents who are members of the Lebanese Order of Physicians. Data analysis was done using descriptive statistics and a chi-square test. Results: The results show a deficiency in the knowledge of physicians regarding many sources of air pollution, including dust, the smell of perfume, candles, vacuum cleaners, air fresheners, electronic cigarettes, etc. The majority of physicians agree that air pollution increases the risk of several health problems. Only 38% of physicians routinely ask their patients about exposure to air pollution, and 75% of them believe that they have a role as physicians in reducing air pollution levels. Over half of the sample are confident in counseling their patients on sources of air pollution, and two thirds of them are in support of including assessment of air pollution exposure during regular medical visits. Conclusion: Air pollution levels are progressively increasing over time. Given the health impact of exposure to air pollution, healthcare professionals need to stay up to date on this topic. The results of this study suggest the need for continuing education about air pollution for physicians and developing guidelines for what exactly to ask patients in assessing their exposure.",air pollution; physicians; Lebanon,,PARTICULATE MATTER; AMBIENT AIR; IMPACT,WOS

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a theory-based educational program to change pollution exposure behavior in pregnant women. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, pregnant women attending a prenatal clinic in Tehran, Iran were selected and randomized into the experimental and control groups. The inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 35 years, having a history of pregnancies without adverse outcomes and not suffering from chronic diseases. Data collected at baseline and 2-month follow-up. At baseline face-to-face interviews were conducted using a valid and reliable questionnaire including items on demographic characteristics, stages of change, self-efficacy, decisional balance and practice regarding air pollution preventive behaviors. The intervention composed of three parts: motivational interviewing, a booklet and daily small message service (SMS). The control group received no intervention except receiving usual care. Follow-up data were collected after the intervention. Data were analyzed performing t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi-squared. Results: In all the data for 104 pregnant women (53 in the intervention and 51 in the control group) were analyzed. The mean age of participants was 27.2 (SD = 4.11) years and it was 22.89 (SD = 8.75) weeks for gestational age. At baseline there were no significant statistical differences between intervention and control groups on the study measures while we found significant group differences in terms of stages of change, self-efficacy, perceived benefits and practice regarding air pollution preventive behaviors at follow-up assessment (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The findings indicated that the TTM-based intervention was effective in increasing air pollution preventive behaviors among pregnant women. This study provided a framework to modify some psychosocial determinants of air pollution preventive behavior other than knowledge using constructs of Transtheoretical model of behavior change, additionally results suggests the importance of education and makes enlightenment of the air pollution risk knowledge accelerate.",Air pollution; Pregnancy; Behavior; Transtheoretical model; Randomized controlled trial,,SMOKING-CESSATION; TRANSTHEORETICAL MODEL; HEALTH; INTERVENTION; STAGE,WOS

Therefore, to explore these responses and evaluate what constitutes publicly acceptable concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), questionnaire surveys were conducted in three representative cities of China: Beijing, Nanjing, and Guangzhou. Great differences in public risk perception were revealed. Public perception of the health effects of air pollution (Effect) and familiarity with it (Familiarity) were significantly higher in the winter than in the summer, and also during severe haze days compared with typical days. The public perception of trust in the government (Trust) was consistent across all conditions. Exposure to severe haze pollution and experiencing harms from it were key factors influencing public willingness to respond to haze. These results reflected individual exposure levels correlating closely with risk perception and acceptance of PM2.5. However, a crucial gap exists between public acceptable risk levels (PARL) of air pollution and the policy objectives of the State Council's Action Plan. Thus, policymakers can utilize this study to develop more targeted measures to combat air pollution.",Atmospheric pollution; Risk perception; PM2.5 exposure; PARL; Action Plan,,NONEXPECTED UTILITY; PUBLIC PERCEPTION; HEALTH-RISK; ANNOYANCE; RESIDENTS; ATTITUDES; PEOPLE; ADULTS; POWER; CARE,WOS

While mitigation of high radon levels in homes has been shown to be effective, home mitigation rates remain low. This study examines the barriers and facilitators to radon mitigation in homes from the perspectives of authorities responsible for radon risk management, the mitigation industry (contractors), and residents in four European countries (Belgium, Ireland, Slovenia, and the UK) with high radon risks and low mitigation rates. Methods: A multi-method approach was used to gather data from various stakeholders, including online surveys, content analysis of legal documents, group interviews, workshops, and focus groups. Results: Authorities, contractors, and residents identified various facilitators to radon mitigation, including legal requirements for mitigation, awareness campaigns, low mitigation costs, availability of financial support, accreditation of mitigation contractors, and a perception of radon as a health threat. However, barriers to mitigation were also identified, such as a lack of awareness, fragmented mitigation processes, and inadequate communication between stakeholders. Discussion: The study highlights the complexity of the radon mitigation process and suggests that interventions aimed at increasing mitigation rates should target stakeholders beyond just residents, such as constructors, health professionals, and policy makers. An integrated approach to radon mitigation, from policy to provision, is necessary to effectively lower levels of this indoor air pollutant.",radon; lung cancer; risk; mitigation; barriers; facilitators,,INDOOR RADON; HEALTH; KNOWLEDGE; RISK; AWARENESS; BEHAVIOR,WOS

The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship among particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 mu m or less (PM2.5) knowledge, PM2.5 preventive attitude, and PM2.5 preventive behavioral intention in the elderly. A cross-sectional survey design was applied in this study, including usage intention and snowball sampling. A total of 617 elderly people aged over 65 participated, and the collected data were quantitatively analyzed. The results showed that the mean score of PM2.5 knowledge of the elderly was 10.34 (79.53%) with the standard deviation (SD) of 3.42, the mean score of PM2.5 preventive attitude was 4.58 (91.60%) with SD of 0.49, and the mean score of PM2.5 preventive behavioral intention was 4.72 (94.40%) with SD of 0.40. Elderly people's characteristics regarding PM2.5 knowledge and PM2.5 preventive attitude explained 22% (adjusted R-2 = 0.22, F = 30.44, P < .001) of the variance in PM2.5 preventive behavioral intention. It is concluded that we found no difference in PM2.5 knowledge, PM2.5 preventive attitude, or PM2.5 preventive behavioral intention among the elderly with or without chronic diseases. In our opinion, health education regarding the threat of PM2.5 to the health of the elderly should be strengthened, to enhance their knowledge, preventive attitude, and preventive behavioral intention of PM2.5.",knowledge; particulate matter; preventive attitude; preventive behavioral intention,,AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; RISK,WOS

A survey of Paterson, New Jersey, residents tested acculturation's associations with attitudes to air pollution and its management, and knowledge of and self-reported behaviors concerning air pollution. Linguistic and temporal proxy measures for acculturation were independent variables along with ethnicity, plus controls for gender, age, education, and income in multivariate analyses. About one-fifth of contrasts between non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, English-interviewed Hispanics, and Spanish-interviewed Hispanics were statistically significant (Bonferroni-corrected) and of medium or higher affect size, with most featuring the Spanish-interviewed Hispanics. Knowledge variables featured the most significant differences. Specifically, Spanish-interviewed Hispanics reported less concern, familiarity with pollution, recognition of high pollution, and vigorous outdoor activity, and greater belief that government overregulates pollution than English-interviewed Hispanics (and than the other two groups on most of these variables too). English-interviewed Hispanics did not differ from non-Hispanic whites, but did on several variables from non-Hispanic blacks. Temporal proxies of acculturation among the foreign-born were far less significant, but concern and familiarity with air pollution increased with time spent in the United States, while belief in overregulation and a positive trend in New Jersey pollution increased with time in the nation of origin.

County government offices, using the unpublished list of households receiving subsidies for thermal solar panel installation, mediated in the implementation of the survey and collected 123 completed questionnaires in May and June 2015. The heteroscedasticity-corrected OLS estimates two equations identifying and quantifying factors influencing the purchase price of solar panels and rural household monthly energy bill savings after installation using the gathered data. Among sociodemographic variables, increasing age was associated with an increasing price paid for the panels, but education was associated with paying a lower price for solar panels and lower self-reported energy bill savings. Panel purchase price increased if the respondent was a farmer, viewed subsidies as important, and preferred domestically manufactured panels. Location of household increased the price as compared to the reference county. Savings on monthly energy bills increased if respondent had a positive view of solar energy, expected a decrease in the bill following the purchase of panels, and heated large areas in the house.

Methods:From June 2015 to January 2016, researchers randomly selected 2 districts from the 20 districts of Baoding, China. Then, researchers randomly selected two middle schools from two districts. By conducting a stratified cluster sampling and considering one class as a unit, researchers randomly selected, from the other middle school, five first-grade classes, five second-grade classes, five third-grade classes from the one middle school, and three first-grade classes, two second-grade classes, and two third-grade classes. Finally, 1,100 adolescents were investigated by using the demographic questionnaire and the Adolescent Haze-Related Knowledge Awareness Assessment Scale (AHRKAAS). Multiple linear regressions were conducted to explore factors affecting the adolescent haze-related knowledge. Sensitivity analysis was used to confirm associations between influencing factors and AHRKAAS scores. Results:The AHRKAAS score rate was 69.9%. The dimension of human factors of haze formation was the highest (score rate = 85.6%). The dimension of haze harms on the human body was the lowest (score rate = 57.1%). Compared with the group (monthly expenses <300 yuan), the group (monthly expenses >= 600 yuan) had a higher AHRKAAS score (beta = 4.882, 95% CI: 0.979, 8.784). Compared with the group (Do not live with parents), the group (Live with parents) had a higher AHRKAAS score (beta = 14.675, 95% CI: 9.494, 19.855).

By examining news headlines and Twitter data in 2015 and 2018, this work finds that media reports blaming China for air pollution doubled during the 2015-2018 period. Discourse surrounding air pollution also shifted: negative sentiment directed at both the Chinese government and the Chinese people increased in 2018 compared to 2015. In addition, an original online survey experiment shows that China-blaming articles have a causal effect on increasing related resentment, particularly toward Chinese people, and that this effect is moderated by age group. Such articles have also had negative effects on foreign policy attitudes via increased anti-Chinese sentiment; greater hostility toward the Chinese people is found to have a causal effect on reduced support for strengthening relations with their country.",Sino-Korea relations; foreign policy attitudes; environmental pollution; public opinion,,ONLINE; OPINION,WOS

However, the mechanism underlying this negative relationship has not been fully explored. This study postulated that this impact may occur through individual resilience, a major psychological capital for adolescents. In addition, we studied interpersonal relations, namely, adolescents' perceived family and teacher support, which may moderate the proposed relationship. Methods: This study combined the three-year tracking survey data of 11-to-15 old adolescents (N=1301; approximately 48% female) in China with objective data from the air quality index (AQI) to measure the level of air pollution.Results: Findings from ordinary least squares analysis indicated that air pollution negatively influences adolescents' prosocial behavior, and their resilience mediates this negative relationship. In addition, the results showed that the negative effect of air pollution on adolescent resilience is attenuated by higher family income, whereas it is accentuated by the absence of teacher support. Conclusion: Our study provides insight into how the negative effect of air pollution on adolescents' prosocial behavior is mediated by their psychological resilience, and highlights the moderating role of adolescents' interpersonal relations in the association between air pollution and their psychological resilience. Our research also provides practical advice on how families, teachers, and psychologists can mitigate this negative impact.",psychological resilience; environment; interpersonal relations; prosocial behavior; adolescents; China,,SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; SCHOOL; YOUTH; AGGRESSION; RESOURCES; CHILDREN; HEALTH,WOS

The results showed that the perceived risks of industrial air pollution were higher than for those of traffic-related air pollution. The perceived risk of industrial air pollution was associated with other variables than that of traffic. For industry, the psychometric variable affect prevailed. For traffic-related air pollution, the demographic variables age and educational level prevailed, although affect was also apparent. Which source was considered as the major sourcetraffic or industrydepended on a high risk perception of industrial air pollution, and not on variation in risk perception of traffic-related air pollution. These insights can be used as an impetus for the local risk management process in the Moerdijk region.

This research proposes to analyze the willingness to pay for reduced air quality in African urban areas. Using survey data from 427 individuals in Dakar (Senegal) between February and May 2019, a double-bound, dichotomous contingent valuation model is developed. The results first suggest that 70% of individuals are indeed willing to pay an average of CFA Francs 3114.8 (USD 5.6) per month to contribute to air quality improvement, and the corresponding value of a life year gained is estimated at CFA Francs 35,550.2 (USD 80) at least. The results also point to a great deal of heterogeneity in individual valuation schemes, as they vary with the perceptions of life expectancy gains, payment vehicles, and various individual characteristics, and also across months with different levels of temperatures. These findings could constitute important inputs into public strategies aimed at improving air quality in the African context.",air pollution; contingent valuation; willingness to pay; value of one life year; Dakar,Dakar [Senegal]; Senegal; air quality; atmospheric pollution; contingent valuation; public attitude; urban area; willingness to pay,CONTINGENT VALUATION; QUALITY,WOS

This study assesses the role of asthma in U.S. adolescents' awareness, perceptions, and behaviors related to air pollution. Methods: In 2020, data were analyzed from 817 adolescents aged 12-17 years who responded to the 2020 Porter Novelli Public Services YouthStyles survey, a nationally representative survey of U.S. adolescents. Respondents self-reported having or having had asthma in the past year and their awareness, perceptions, and behaviors related to air pollution. For each aspect of air quality awareness, perception, and behavior, weighted percentages of responses were calculated by asthma status. Results: Overall, an estimated 11.5% of U.S. adolescents self-reported asthma. Awareness that air pollution can impact health, awareness that respondents can limit their air pollution exposure, and having heard or read about air quality alerts were similar among adolescents with and without asthma, with some differences reported in where they heard or read about air quality alerts. Those with asthma reported discussing with a health professional about ways to limit exposure more frequently than those without asthma. Conclusions: Despite the well-known risk of asthma exacerbations from air pollution exposure, air quality awareness was similar among adolescents with and without asthma. These findings reveal the areas in which air quality awareness and behaviors to reduce exposure can be improved among adolescents with and without asthma.

We systematically collected social data through semi-structured surveys distributed via online platforms. Our aim was to gather comprehensive information on the perception of pollution sources and the effectiveness of control systems. We examined citizens’ habits and their suggestions to improve air quality. The results revealed the following: (1) In Turin, the perception of air pollution significantly influences individuals’ self-assessments of health. Consequently, increased vigilance is required to mitigate environmental health risks and to disseminate information on air quality and effective practices for reducing air pollution. (2) The use of sustainable transportation in Turin is hindered due to the inadequate maintenance of cycling infrastructure. Citizens prefer to use cars or trains, which facilitate rapid travel. (3) In Dublin, greater sensitivity to the problem of air pollution has emerged, and the use of sustainable means of transport is facilitated via ad hoc infrastructure. These results provide empirical evidence to policymakers to support the promotion of concrete local actions through which to improve air quality. © 2024 by the authors.",air quality; citizen behavior; Europe; qualitative survey,,,Scopus

Perceptions in the neighbourhoods were examined by individual socio-demographic factors (age, gender, marital and immigrant status, education, etc.) in addition to perceived health status and neighbourhood problems (environmental, social and safety concerns). Neighbourhood variations were found, with those residing in the Southwest Mountain neighbourhood being over 6 times more likely to report a 'good' perception of air quality than those residing in the Lower City neighbourhood. In addition, factors influencing these perceptions also varied by neighbourhood. Perceived neighbourhood problems strongly influenced perceptions of air quality in the Lower City and Central areas, whereas socio-demographic factors were significant primarily in the Lower City neighbourhood, suggesting the importance of these mediating dimensions; pointing to less of a concern about air quality. There was, however, remarkable consistency in all three neighbourhoods when respondents were asked whether their perception of air quality affected their choice to go outside.

Our novel experimental design exploits naturally occurring discontinuities in pollution episodes to mimic an experimental setting in which pollution exposure is exogenously manipulated, thus allowing us to identify a causal relationship. Participants were randomly assigned to be surveyed on either high pollution or low pollution days, thereby exogenously varying the degree of pollution exposure. In addition, a subset of individuals surveyed on the high-pollution days received an additional 'pollution alert' to explore whether providing air pollution warnings influences (protective) behaviour. We used a set of well-established incentivised economic games to obtain clean measures of anti-social behaviour, as well as a range of secondary outcomes which may drive the proposed pollution-behaviour relationship. Our results indicate that exposure to acute air pollution had no statistically significant effect on anti-social behaviour, but significantly reduced both psychological and physiological well-being. However, these effects do not remain statistically significant after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing. We find no evidence that pollution affects cognitive ability, present bias, discounting, or risk aversion, four potential pathways which may explain the relationship between pollution and anti-social behaviour. Our study adds to the growing calls for purposefully designed and pre-registered experiments that strengthen experimental (as opposed to correlational or quasi -experimental) identification and thus allow causal insights into the relationship between pollution and anti-social behaviour.",Air pollution; Causal inference; Decision-making; Economic preferences; Environmental stressors; Randomised experiment; Social preferences,Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Cognition; Humans; Problem Solving; Beijing [China]; China; atmospheric pollution; decision making; environmental stress; experimental design; experimental study; social behavior; adult; air pollution; antisocial behavior; article; China; cognition; controlled study; decision making; experimental design; female; field experiment; human; male; outcome assessment; randomized controlled trial; risk aversion; social preference; wellbeing; problem solving,PRODUCTIVITY EVIDENCE; COGNITIVE DECLINE; DECISION-MAKING; SELF-CONTROL; HEALTH; EXPOSURE; QUALITY; CRIME; RISK; PREFERENCES,WOS

The rise in air pollution is associated with an increased probability of purchasing medical insurance. Results suggest that the effect of air pollution on the demand for medical insurance may be overestimated without considering the migration of people. Furthermore, the substitution between basic medical and commercial insurance is becoming increasingly evident with the reform of the medical system. The effect of air pollution on the demand for medical insurance is mainly observed on women, children, the elderly, and people with high income and educational levels, all of whom are more likely to take an avoidance behavior. This study suggests that environmental issues must be considered in future medical insurance designs due to avoidance behavior to mitigate the negative effects of poor air quality. Avoidance costs must also be considered when governments formulate environmental policies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted a survey about trip plan changes due to poor air quality in South Korea, and used an integrated choice and latent variable model to verify the hypotheses in the framework. The result reveals that high perceived health risk encourages people to seek related information, which induces more trip plan changes under poor air quality. People with greater perceived risk tend to make more drastic trip-related decisions by changing or even canceling trip schedules. Moreover, higher-income groups generally perceive greater health risks and eventually seek relevant information more.

The data used were obtained from environmental measurements, in situ and from stations, and questionnaire surveys conducted in an outdoor urban Mediterranean area, Athens, Greece. The participants were asked to report their air quality perception and thermal sensation based on predefined scales. A thermal index, Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET), was estimated to obtain an objective measure of thermal sensation. Particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen oxide (NO) were associated with dust perception. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) were associated to air quality perception. Age, area of residence, health symptoms and thermal sensation also affected the perception of air quality. Dusty or poor air quality conditions were more likely to be reported when pollutants' concentrations were increased. Younger people, participants residing in the city center, experiencing health symptoms or warm thermal sensation showed a trend towards reporting more unfavorable air quality conditions.

Many of these services can only be realized when people visit parks. Particulate matter exposure poses negative health impacts and may turn the health benefits brought by park visits into health risks. This tradeoff relationship is heavily moderated by how individuals behave under varying ambient air quality conditions. While there is a growing evidence base regarding the benefits brought by urban parks, little is known about how people adjust their park visitation to air pollution. Here we use two approaches to understand if air quality affects urban park visits in Beijing: a stated preference survey on social media and a year-long faceto-face survey in a neighborhood park. Quantile regression and ANOVA analysis were used. We found particulate pollution has a negative impact on the maximum number of visits a park may receive. A significant drop occurred when the pollution level changed from moderate to heavy pollution. Therefore, the ecosystem services provided by parks are not fully realized due to the reduced number of visits caused by air pollution. Second, regardless of how poor air quality is, a proportion of people (41-64%) put themselves at exposure risk to enjoy the benefits brought by parks. Third, the inconsistency between behavior and intention signals people are less protected from the potential adverse health impacts of poor air quality than they think. Future study should look into what factors may cause the divergence between people's intentions and behaviors. Understandings on this issue will contribute to design better guidance and incentives to reduce the adverse health cost of air pollution exposure from park visitation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Overall, 400 questionnaires were completed, of which 336 were valid. Results of independent t-test indicated that although the air quality of Xiangshan was better than Shoushan for long periods of time, Xiangshan hikers were more likely to use absolute substitution than Shoushan hikers when facing air pollution. Moreover, based on the results of the regression analysis, perception of air pollution and stress associated with air pollution were determined to be correlated with coping behaviours. Behavioural coping strategies rather than cognitive coping strategies were employed when hikers encountered air pollution. Finally, managerial implications and suggestions for future research were proposed based on the results.",Outdoor recreation; air quality; coping strategy; hiking; tourists,China; Jiangxi; Xiangshan; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; perception; questionnaire survey; tourist behavior,TIME PHYSICAL INACTIVITY; OUTDOOR RECREATION; ASSOCIATION; SUBSTITUTABILITY; SUBSTITUTION; TOURISM; QUALITY; ANGLERS; ALERTS; HEALTH,WOS

A range of multidimensional indicators, including demographic and socioeconomic features, health status data, and living environment factors, were utilized to evaluate observed awareness and exposure activities. Air pollution is a serious health concern in many areas of Serbia, particularly during the cold season when emissions from the heating sector contribute to high levels of particulate matter. In the period from March to May 2023, a nationwide survey was conducted to gather empirical data and insights that can assist policymakers in the creation of public-health strategies. A set of research questions included the perception of air-pollution impact and citizens' responses to eight pre-defined exposure-reduction activities. Statistical procedures (a chi-square test of independence, a Mann-Whitney U test, and a Kruskal-Wallis H test) were applied to isolate driving factors in the public response to increased air-pollution levels. The findings suggest a gap between risk understanding and risk-reducing behaviors. To address this issue and to ensure that regulations are implemented effectively, it is crucial to prioritize education, develop communication strategies, increase local interventions, and target vulnerable population groups.",air pollution; multidimensional drivers; public perception; exposure behaviors; Serbia,Serbia; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; health status; health survey; heating; public attitude; risk perception,QUALITY; HEALTH; UNDERSTANDINGS,WOS

Consistent exceedances of the nitrogen dioxide air quality limit values at a roadside monitoring station in Potsdam, owing to heavy local and commuter individual motorized traffic, prompted the city administration to implement a trial traffic measure aimed at reducing motorized traffic to improve air quality. This study analysed data (n = 3553) from a questionnaire carried out prior to the implementation of the trial traffic measure. This research provides a case-study to contribute to the understanding of general determinants of air quality perceptions, and policy-relevant information regarding how citizens perceive air quality in the context of a 'hard' policy measure. A subset of variables was used to build an ordinal logistic regression model to assess the explanatory power for air quality perceptions. Gender, perceived health status, level of concern for air quality, level of concern for climate change, and the desire for greater access to information regarding air quality were factors found to be significant in their explanatory power of perceptions of air quality.

To fill this research gap, this study examined the effect of numerical data through monitoring devices on the occupants’ perception of IAQ. Therefore, an experiment was planned to evaluate the perceived IAQ based on a self-report questionnaire among ten subjects in an office environment. The experiment was divided into three sessions, with a classification model built for each session using automated machine learning and then derived variable importance for predictor variables. Results showed that when occupants did not check the numerical data of IAQ factors, they tended to perceive IAQ based on the perceived thermal comfort. In addition, occupants made a biased judgment of the current IAQ condition based on the past perceived IAQ checked 30 min ago. When occupants checked the numerical data of IAQ factors, they responded more sensitively to IAQ factors than to thermal environment factors when perceiving IAQ conditions. The results of this study confirmed that real-time numerical data of IAQ factors measured using monitoring devices are essential for occupants to perceive and judge the current IAQ clearly. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Indoor air quality; Indoor environment quality; Monitoring device; Perceived IAQ; Perception; Variable importance analysis,Air quality; Patient monitoring; Quality control; Importance analysis; Indoor air quality; Indoor environments qualities; Monitoring device; Numerical data; Perceived indoor air quality; Quality factors; Variable importance analyse; Variable importances; air quality; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; environmental quality; indoor air; perception; Indoor air pollution,,Scopus

Thus, this study explores the factors that influence the willingness to pay (WTP) on behalf of the citizens to reduce air pollution generated by road transport. In doing so, we propose two fundamental theoretical frameworks to explain individual behavior towards the environment actions: the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) models. A questionnaire survey with 1,612 residents was used to collect data in 65 localities located in the Spanish Pyrenees and performing a statistical analysis with the resulting data relied on application of Structural Equation Models (SEM).

Moreover, 90% of the 150,000 patients at Al Ain Hospital suffered from upper respiratory tract respiratory diseases, bronchitis, or asthma. Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) has emerged as a social problem in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Dubai Municipality regulates Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) with strict stipulations before moving in, but they are relatively passive about regulations related to healthy living. This paper aims to explore the actual state of perception of the IAQ from townhouse residents in Dubai, UAE. The characteristics of the resident's perceptions of the IAQ are identified, and the influential factors affecting residents' perceptions of IAQ are extracted. As a methodology, the survey was conducted on four townhouse projects in Dubai from December 2021 to January 2022. A total of 114 copies were distributed, and 98 documents were used. Analysis of the survey data was processed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0. The results showed a statistically significant correlation between the cognitive and anxiety levels of SBS with the presence or absence of experience. It was statistically confirmed that the most influential factors were the age of the children and the occupancy time of housewives and children. This is because of the perception that wives who spend a relatively long time in the house and their young children are exposed to indoor air pollution for a long period of time and are easily affected by this influence on the concerns about young children about SBS. Ninety-five percent of the respondents answered that they knew more than average about SBS, indicating a very high level of awareness. As for the degree of anxiety, 87.0% of the respondents felt higher levels of anxiety than usual. However, most of them did not know or were indifferent to the understanding of the air quality improvement methods.

As part of an atmospheric pollution reduction plan, the Santiago Regional Metropolitan government defined an environmental policy goal of using urban forests to remove particulate matter less than 10 mu m (PM10) in the Gran Santiago area. We used cost effectiveness, or the process of establishing costs and selecting least cost alternatives for obtaining a defined policy goal of PM10 removal, to analyze this policy goal. For this study, we quantified PM10 removal by Santiago's urban forests based on socioeconomic strata and using field and real-time pollution and climate data via a dry deposition urban forest effects model. Municipal urban forest management costs were estimated using management cost surveys and Chilean Ministry of Planning and Cooperation documents. Results indicate that managing municipal urban forests(trees, shrubs, and grass whose management is under the jurisdiction of Santiago's 36 municipalities) to remove PM10 was a cost-effective policy for abating PM10 based on criteria set by the World Bank. In addition, we compared the cost effectiveness of managing municipal urban forests and street trees to other control policies (e.g. alternative fuels) to abate PM10 in Santiago and determined that municipal urban forest management efficiency was similar to these other air quality improvement measures.

Poor air quality has been associated with adverse pulmonary and cardiac health effects, particularly among susceptible populations with underlying disease. In addition to reducing pollution concentrations, risk communication efforts that inform behavior modification have the potential to reduce public health burdens associated with air pollution. Methods: This study investigates the utilization of Mexico's IMECA risk communication index to inform air pollution avoidance behavior among the general population living in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area. Individuals were selected via probability sampling and surveyed by phone about their air quality index knowledge, pollution concerns, and individual behaviors. Results: The results indicated reasonably high awareness of the air quality index (53% of respondents), with greater awareness in urban areas, among older and more educated individuals, and for those who received air quality information from a healthcare provider. Additionally, behavior modification was less influenced by index reports as it was by personal perceptions of air quality, and there was no difference in behavior modification among susceptible and non-susceptible groups. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest there are opportunities to improve the public health impact of risk communication through an increased focus on susceptible populations and greater encouragement of public action in response to local air quality indices.",Air quality index; Risk communication; Behavior modification; Air pollution,,POLLUTION; PARTICULATE; ASSOCIATION; CHILDREN,WOS

Thus, this paper pays attention to residents' willingness to buy anti-haze cosmetics through customer perceived value theory. In this study, it is assumed that all consumers are rational economic people and that anti-haze cosmetics on the market can effectively cleanse, isolate and repair haze damage. Based on customer perceived value theory and the characteristic of anti-haze cosmetics, four main drivers and had been selected out, that is, monetary value, social value, brand value and perceived haze awareness. Then, based on 314 valid questionnaires, the structural equation analysis method had been used to analyze the impact of the four dimensions of customer perceived value theory on perceived value and consumers' purchase intention of anti-haze cosmetics. The empirical results showed that monetary value, social value, and perceived haze awareness had positive impact on perceived value and purchase intention of anti-haze cosmetics, while brand value only affects perceived value. Perceived value was a partial mediator between the relations of monetary value, social value, perceived haze awareness and purchase intention, while played a completely mediating role between brand value and purchase intention. Then, we also found that price sensitivity played a significant down-modulatory role in perceived value and purchase intention. Furthermore, the perceived haze awareness is the term that we first proposed in this realm, which extends and optimizes Customer Perceived Value. Finally, according to the survey results, consumers would be willing to pay an additional 56.1 yuan per month for the anti-haze effect of cosmetics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It is associated with urbanization and social and economic structures. The understanding of how social factors can influence the perception and the potential impact of air pollution have not been addressed sufficiently. This paper addresses the social vulnerability and exposure to PM(10)association and its influence on the air quality perception of residents in Mexicali, a Mexico-US border city. This study used individual variables and population census data, as well as statistical and spatial analyses. A cluster of socially vulnerable populations with high exposure to coarse particulate matter (PM10) was found in the city's peripheral areas. The spatial distribution of the local perception of air quality varied by the exposure zones of the estimated PM(10)concentrations. Respondents living in very high exposure areas perceive air quality as poor, contrarily to a worse perception in areas of intermediate and lower exposure to PM10. Proximity to stationary sources of pollution was associated with a poor perception of air quality. Results also indicate that low household income and poor air quality perceived at the place of residence negatively influences the perceived changes in the air quality over time. The knowledge of chronic health effects related to air pollution was scarce in the sampled population, especially in the areas with very high exposure and high social vulnerability.

In this study, the research aim was to monitor the air quality of a renovated building and assess the impact of sick building syndrome (SBS) on the occupants. Post occupancy monitoring of the building was carried out after two months occupancy for the following environmental parameters: airborne microflora using an air sampler (SAS super 180) and a hand-held monitoring device (Graywolf advance sense IQ-610) to measure total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), CO2, CO and temperature and relative humidity in each office environment. In addition, an online (Qualtrics) structured questionnaire was used to assess occupants' perceptions of the indoor environment. Results of the airborne flora showed 833 cfu/m(3) recovered on a Malt Extract Agar (MEA) plate in the morning and 1213 cfu/m(3) in the afternoon. A similar result was noticed on a Plate Count Agar (PCA) plate during the morning period (731 cfu/m(3)) and afternoon (1358 cfu/m(3)).

The study aimed to develop relationship between degraded air quality and resident's willingness to pay for improved air quality in city of Lahore, Pakistan through contingent valuation method to quantify an individual's willingness to pay for improved air quality. Hypothetical market was created and 250 respondents, selected through random sampling, were asked to respond to pre tested questionnaire. Results revealed that 92.5% of respondents showed positive willingness to pay and average predicted willingness to pay by each person was $9.86 per month.

Stepwise Regression model was used to develop relationship between independent variables and willingness to pay. Most parameters accompanied by econometric analysis elaborated expected results. Results disclosed that annual household income, symptoms of respiratory diseases and self observed air pollution pointedly impact willingness to pay. It is concluded that despite of the fact that Pakistan is among the lower income countries with no rigid budget allocation for improvement in air quality, people of Pakistan are willing to pay to reduce air pollution load. One of the factor which effected the positivity of willingness to pay is that, a quite large number of people were suffering from pollution related respiratory disorders like asthma, chronic bronchitis, wheezing, cough, and chest congestion.

Attempting to quit smoking is an important step toward smoking cessation. Although it has been studied extensively, limited information on the association between attempts to quit smoking and neighborhood air quality problems is available. Therefore, we examined the association between attempts to quit smoking in the past year and perceived neighborhood air quality problems among adult Texans who smoke.Methods In 2018, a cross-sectional multistage area probability design-based survey was administered to collect sociodemographic, behavioral, and health-related information from a representative sample of 2050 Texas residents. The current study included 486 adult respondents who reported smoking within the past 12 months. The association between attempts to quit smoking and perceived neighborhood air quality (measured by self-reported problems with neighborhood air quality) was examined using a population-weighted multivariable logistic regression analysis.Results Overall, 60.7% of the 486 respondents attempted to quit cigarette smoking. The prevalence of attempting to quit was 74.6% for those reporting perceived neighborhood air quality problems. In the multivariable analysis, a higher likelihood of attempting to quit smoking was found among individuals with perceived neighborhood air quality problems (AOR: 1.906 [1.104-3.289]) and those who were married or living as married (AOR: 1.876 [1.161-3.033]). The likelihood of attempts to quit smoking was lower among males (AOR: 0.629 [0.397-0.995]) and decreased with age (AOR: 0.968 [0.951-0.984]).Discussion The perceived neighborhood air quality problems were found to independently predict attempts to quit cigarette smoking in Texas. To encourage quitting smoking among individuals living in neighborhoods with poor air quality, such neighborhoods should receive tailored and evidence-based interventions to improve community education, social support, and healthcare professionals' assistance to quit smoking.",cigarette smoking; attempt to quit smoking; air quality; neighborhood; Texas,,SOCIAL SUPPORT; UNITED-STATES; CESSATION; HEALTH; PREDICTORS; POLLUTION; BEHAVIOR; ADULTS; MODEL,WOS

One of the ways of changing this negative trend is to maintain green areas and trees within cities, as they serve many ecosystem functions, including biological absorption of particles and other types of air pollution. This article provides the findings of a study carried out among the residents of Warsaw, the capital of Poland, in order to assess social awareness of air pollution and the importance of trees. The study of the residents’ awareness was supplemented with the assessment of the parameters of the trees’ capacity for pollution absorption in selected locations performed with the help of the i‐Tree Eco tool, which allowed the authors to compare the residents’ impressions on the role of trees in the process of absorption of pollution with their actual potential. The analyses showed that the majority of city residents are concerned with the problem of air in the city, but at the same time failing to notice its negative impact on their health. The majority of respondents were not aware of the role the trees play in the process of pollution absorption, suggesting that there is a real need for raising social awareness of functions served by trees and green areas in urban spaces. The comparison of the city residents’ opinions on the importance of trees in the process of pollution absorption with objective data obtained with the help of i‐Tree Eco tool shows that the majority of peopleʹs impressions of pollution absorption by trees in urban areas is correct. © 2021 by the authors.

We conducted a stratified sampling questionnaire survey among 1988 college students from throughout China studying in Nanjing, to examine how risk perceptions are influenced by socioeconomic factors and historical exposure among the high-educated young generation who will become leaders in future air pollution risk management and communications. First, a six-factor confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to estimate risk perception levels from the observable indices. 40 % of the participants felt air pollution levels in Nanjing were unacceptable, which suggested that air pollution control actions do not meet public expectations at the survey time. Hierarchical k-means clustering demonstrated difference in the spatial distribution of risk perception. Results showed that students from the northern part of China had higher risk acceptance, lower perceived risk, and higher government trust than other regions. Females, older participants, participants with higher education, and participants with higher economic levels were identified as risk-sensitive groups to air pollution by using linear regression analyses. The regression coefficients of risk perception and historical exposure decreased as the days tracking back to a pollution episode increased. The cut-off point where regression coefficients turned from significant to non-significant was around 60 days for risk acceptance, 10 days for perceived benefit, and 30 days for government trust.

Consistent with the scholarly narrative, results show that air quality is rated worse where minorities and poverty are concentrated, even after extensive adjustment for objective pollution and built environment measures.

Moreover, this study also allowed to understand which information about air quality needs further dissemination to provide the citizens with all the available tools and the correct knowledge. For this, a national online survey about air quality perception was conducted, where 1131 answers were obtained and two different populations were compared: the general population and a sub-population from an urban-industrial area of Lisbon metropolitan area that had experienced frequent air pollution events in the past. Air pollution was considered the environmental topic of higher concern among this sub-population (61.4%), while in the general population it ranked thirdly (27.4%). Generally, the sub-population showed higher knowledge about air quality than the general population, with 61% being able to identify at least one air pollutant. The perception of the local air quality was also very different between populations, with 61% of the sub-population considering it poor or very poor, while only 14% of the general population had the same perception, which highlights the different levels of concern between populations. A weak knowledge about air pollutants (50% of the general population could not identify any air pollutant) and an erroneous perception of the contribution of the different pollution sources to air quality levels were found. More than 50% of the respondents of both populations were considered to not have enough information regarding the air quality in their area of residence, with the national air quality database being unknown to almost everyone. Overall, strong efforts should be made to increase the awareness about the importance of air quality, which may promote a higher acceptance of the implementation of future actions to improve air quality.",air pollution; air pollutants; sources; perception; air quality; citizens' awareness; Portugal,,POLLUTION; HEALTH; RISK,WOS

This study investigates how people acquire information about the environment and EVs, and whether their opinions about environmental efficacy change over time and experience levels. These issues are explored across two data sets. The first data set is a panel survey of California households (n = 1718) and environmental opinions are tracked over two waves of survey. A decline in the environmental ethos is associated with several factors, including interpersonal communications and exposure to more specialized media. A sample of households from the panel study were subsequently chosen, among others, to participate in a 2-week long trial of EVs (n = 69). Opinions about environmental efficacy are studied as users gain first hand knowledge of an EV. Opinions about the environmental efficacy of the EV show improvement, but trial users become less likely to cite the environmental benefit as a reason for choosing the technology, and they do not change their opinions about providing policy incentives.

However, not all people are willing to change their behaviours; even when they do, the level of action varies. This study investigated how empoweredness (self-efficacy, individual response efficacy, collective response efficacy, hope, and values) and trust in government information affect the protective actions citizens take against particulate matter (PM) risk, by expanding on the extended parallel process model (EPPM). We analyzed the case of Seoul, South Korea, where nationwide environmental concern in regard to PM pollution recently led to intense policy measures and public communication efforts. To test our conceptual model, we conducted an online survey with 513 Seoul citizens on their perception of PM risk and their behaviour during high PM episodes. Our regression results revealed two key findings. First, perceived risk, self-efficacy, individual response efficacy, and trust in government information were positively associated with protective behaviours, supporting our hypotheses. Second and more importantly, trust in government information was found to be moderate the effects of self-efficacy, individual response efficacy, collective response efficacy, and hope on protective behaviour against PM pollution. This suggests trust can be a boundary condition that allows an individual's empoweredness to be fully extended to behavioural change. Our study demonstrates the possibility of expanding EPPM applications in pro-environmental behaviour studies by adding new variables that can be factored into future risk communication.HIGHLIGHTSWe explore the effects of empoweredness and trust in government information on protective behaviour against particulate matter in Korea.Empoweredness is measured by three types of efficacies, hope, and values.Survey responses are statistically analyzed to capture the associations between variables.Self-efficacy, values, and trust are positively associated with protective behaviour.Trust in government moderates some associations between empoweredness and protective action.",Particulate matter; public risk communication; extended parallel process model; empowerment; trust in government information; Seoul,,COGNITIVE APPRAISAL THEORY; AIR-POLLUTION; COLLECTIVE EFFICACY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PUBLIC TRUST; FEAR APPEALS; POLICY; EMPOWERMENT; QUALITY; ANXIETY,WOS

In seven European cities, 7622 adult participants were recruited to complete an online questionnaire on travel and physical activity behaviour, perceptions and attitudes on active mobility and the environment, and sociodemographics. Air pollution at the home address was determined using Europe-wide PM2.5 and NO2 land use regression models.

Fifty-eight percent of participants were worried over health effects of air pollution with large differences across cities (Antwerp 78%, Barcelona 81%, London 64%, Orebro 11%, Rome 72%, Vienna 43%, Zurich 33%). Linking mean modelled air pollution to mean level of concern per city gave a good correlation for NO2 (r(2) = 0.75), and a lower correlation for PM2.5 (r(2) = 0.49). In the regression model, sex, having children in the household, levels of physical activity, and NO2 at the home address were significantly linked to individual concern over health effects of air pollution.

Context often provides the basis for studying information behaviour, and much of it has been studied in terms of particular occupations, roles, or socioeconomic status. A less studied, but as important basis is crisis coping as shaping information seeking. This paper focuses on a haze crisis as one such situation, and examines the information seeking behaviour of concerned working students coping with the crisis using Miller's coping styles and Johnson's comprehensive model of information seeking as the main theoretical framework. Method. A survey utilising proportionate quota sampling was administered to 339 students who hold a job in Singapore during the Southeast Asian Haze Crisis in 2012. Analysis. T-tests and analysis of variance were used to determine the effect of coping styles on each of the four antecedents in Johnson's model, and these factors were also studied for their influences in shaping information seeking on four information sources. Results. Coping style was found to be a significant variable in influencing three of the four antecedents in the comprehensive model: demographics (age), experience, and salience. Significant effects are also found for age, experience, salience, beliefs, and coping styles on information seeking in mainstream media, new media, personal networks, and healthcare professionals. Conclusions. The study demonstrated the importance of incorporating coping style as a contingent factor to be incorporated into CMIS to better understand information seeking behaviour in a crisis.",,,HEALTH INFORMATION; PERCEPTIONS; JUDGMENT,WOS

To examine Beijing residents’ protective behavioral intentions against smog, we proposed a conceptual model, which applies the health belief model (HBM) and specifies the roles of three distal predictors: exposure to news, discussion, and worry. The proposed model was tested in the context of protective behavioral intentions (i.e., intention to wear facemask & intention to use air purifier). Data were collected from Beijing residents during the period from 2/27 to 3/7 in 2017. Structural-equation-modeling (SEM) analyses of valid cases (N = 523) found support for the health belief model regarding the positive effects of perceived threat, perceived benefit, and perceived self-efficacy on intention to wear facemask or intention to use air purifier. Perceived barrier has a negative effect on intention to use air purifier, but is not related to intention to wear facemask. Neither exposure nor discussion is related to perceived threat. The effect of worry on intention to wear facemaskor intention to use air purifier is mediated by perceived threat. This proposed mediating mechanism is superior to the reverse mechanism (that worry mediates perceived threat). Implications of findings were discussed. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Beijing; Health Behavior; Health Belief Model; Humans; Intention; Smog; Surveys and Questionnaires; behavior; China; health behavior; Health Belief Model; human; questionnaire; smog,,Scopus

In particular, the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) annual limit-value set by the European Union of 40 μg/m3 was not met at ~40% of roadside monitoring stations across German cities in 2018. In response to this issue, many cities are experimenting with various traffic-reducing measures targeting diesel passenger vehicles so as to reduce emissions of NO2 and improve air quality. Identifying the determinants of public acceptance for these measures using a systematic approach can help inform policy-makers in other German cities. Survey data generated from a questionnaire in Potsdam, Germany, were used in predictive models to quantify support for investments in traffic-reducing measures generally and to quantify support for a specific traffic-reducing measure implemented in Potsdam in 2017. This exploratory analysis found that general support for investments in such measures was most strongly predicted by environmental and air pollution perception variables, whereas specific support for the actual traffic measure was most strongly predicted by mobility habits and preferences. With such measures becoming more common in German cities and across Europe, these results exemplify the complexity of factors influencing public acceptance of traffic-reducing policies, highlight the contrasting roles environmental beliefs and mobility habits play in determining support for such measures, and emphasize the connections between mobility, air pollution, and human health. © 2019 by the authors.",Air quality; Public acceptance; Transdisciplinary; Transport policy; Urban,Brandenburg [Germany]; Germany; Potsdam; air quality; atmospheric pollution; diesel engine; European Union; nitrogen dioxide; perception; pollution incidence; traffic emission,,Scopus

Methods:Considering primary prevention, secondary prevention and tertiary prevention as a theoretical basis, researchers developed a Brief Haze Weather Health Protection Behavior Assessment Scale-Adolescent Version-I(BHWHPBAS-AV-I). After performing 6 reviews by related experts, and after conducting six adolescent tests for BHWHPBAS-AV-I, researchers developed an updated BHWHPBAS-AV-II. Out of the 20 districts in Baoding, two districts were randomly selected; moreover, two middle schools from these two districts were also randomly selected. Considering one class as a unit, researchers subsequently randomly selected 22 classes by using stratified sampling. In the end, 1,025 valid questionnaires were used as part of the study. At which point, researchers investigated the validity and reliability of the scale and obtained the final scale (BHWHPBAS-AV). Results:BHWHPBAS-AV Cronbach's alpha = 0.878, content validity = 0.948, and factor cumulative contribution rate = 54.058% using exploratory factor analysis.

In order to understand haze risk perception and related influencing factors among college students in Beijing, we developed and verified two scales, with college students as the survey object, and analyzed the theoretical framework and realistic level of haze risk perception and influencing factors through empirical research. We showed that the reliability and validity of the two scales are excellent, and they can be used as a powerful tool to measure college students' perception of haze. The haze risk perception scale (HRPS) is divided into four dimensions. The degrees of perception ranked from high to low are: direct consequences perception, indirect consequences perception, risk responsibility perception and risk source perception. The haze risk perception influencing factor scale (HRPIFS) is divided into three dimensions. The degrees of influence ranked from high to low are: personal emotion, media communication and government policy; the three influencing factors all have a significant positive correlation to overall haze risk perception, but personal emotions and media communication are only significantly related to the three dimensions of direct consequence perception, indirect consequence perception and risk source perception. Government policy is only significantly related to the three dimensions of direct consequence perception, indirect consequence perception and risk liability perception. This paper proves the important role of media in haze risk perception and puts forward some policy suggestions to guide the public to form a rational risk perception. These findings can help improve theoretical and practical research related to haze risk.",haze; risk perception; influencing factors; scale; college students in Beijing,,RESPONSIBILITY; POLLUTION; CHINA; ATTRIBUTION; RESPONSES; EXPOSURE; PM2.5; TRUST; CITY,WOS

Therefore, developing a valid and reliable instrument is imperative to assess runners' beliefs and perceptions regarding risks and health behaviors. This study developed a comprehensive questionnaire based on the health behavior model and relevant literature. The questionnaire was tested with 310 responses from individuals with running race experiences in Taiwan. Tests of the measurement model were conducted using reliability and confirmatory factor analysis. The results reveal that the questionnaire consists of eight constructs: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, perceived self-efficacy, cues to action, health behavior intention, and awareness of air quality. The 31 items jointly accounted for 72.71% of the observed variance. All eight factors have good internal consistency, convergent, and discriminant validity with acceptable model fit indexes.

Clean Air Zones (CAZs) which restrict the entry of polluting vehicles in targeted areas have been identified as potentially effective in improving health and reducing air pollution; however, their implementation can be controversial.Methods: A cross-sectional survey was completed by 1949 respondents who lived or worked in Bradford, a multi-cultural deprived city in England, between April and December 2021. Of these, 1137 were recruited from the longitudinal Born in Bradford (BiB) family cohort (families with children born in the city during 2007-2011) and 812 were from the general public. Bradford is the seventh largest metropolitan district in England and Wales with a population of over half a million mainly white British and Pakistani origin. The BiB families cohort and the general public respondents were used for descriptive analysis of perception of air quality and acceptability of CAZ, then the relationship between participants responses with demographic characteristics were investigated using the BiB families cohort. Outcomes included perceptions of air quality and acceptability of the CAZ supplemented by free-text questions. Thematic analysis was used to code free-text data. Descriptive analyses were performed on the entire sample. Latent class analysis was used to characterise participants was performed in the BiB dataset for whom detailed existing socio-demographic data were available.Results: The majority of participants (67%) considered improving air quality in Bradford as extremely important; 70% supported implementation of the CAZ. Three latent classes were identified within the BiB sample: deprived white British families (25%), more affluent white British families (32%) and deprived Pakistani-origin families (43%). Deprived white British (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.84) and more affluent white British families (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.79) were less likely to say the air quality was good/excellent when compared with deprived Pakistani-origin families. Affluent White British families were more likely to support the CAZ compared with deprived white British families (OR = 2.24; 95% CI: 1.55. to 3.25) and deprived Pakistani-origin families (OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.50 to 2.85). Qualitative analysis suggested that a perceived lack of cohesion in the policy and concerns about financial impacts drove negative attitudes.Conclusion: Families in Bradford were generally supportive of the planned CAZ and efforts to reduce pollution; however, support was weaker in more deprived communities. Pakistani-origin communities living in deprived areas perceived air quality as better than other groups. Tailored approaches to communicate about the proposed benefits of policies such as CAZ prior to implementation may be an important way to increase acceptability amongst vulnerable groups.",Air pollution; Air quality; Clean air zone; Low emission zone; Attitudes; Acceptability,,HEALTH IMPACT; BRADFORD; CHILDREN; BORN; CITY,WOS

This paper employs segmentation techniques to examine the heterogeneity of individuals' adaptive and mitigation behaviors in response to air pollution. We administered a survey in Beijing and obtained a valid sample of 979 respondents. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified three distinct segments of respondents: Activists (50.5%) who are most active in adaptation and mitigation; Mitigators (33.1%) who are fairly active in mitigation but inactive in adaptation; and Adaptors (16.4%) who are fairly active in adaptation but inactive in mitigation. They are distinguishable in terms of age, gender, education, smoking habits, and having respiratory diseases. Two important factors, i.e., risk perception and causal attribution, show different patterns in their influence on the different types of resonsive behaviors across the three segments. Risk perception is a positive predictor of adaptive behaviors and an insignificant predictor of mitigation behaviors; causal attribution has different influences on mitigation behaviors of the respondents in the different segments. Our study highlights the need to design tailored messages to motivate different segments of the population to adapt to and mitigate environmental risks.",Air pollution; Risk perception; Causal attribution; Segmentation analysis,,SELF-EFFICACY; BELIEFS; RESPONSIBILITY; MITIGATION; GENDER; RACE; WILLINGNESS; PERFORMANCE; ADJUSTMENT; HAZARD,WOS

We thus examine how people's attitudes towards distributive justice affect their preferences for programmes aimed at reducing ambient air pollution resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels for residential heating. To do so, we carried out two multifactorial survey experiments that allowed us to incorporate justice attitudes into non-market valuation. The first experiment focused on recording justice attitudes towards payment distribution for air quality improvement, while the second experiment measured the willingness to pay for air pollution reduction programmes. Both experiments were conducted with the same respondents, from four cities in Poland, and were conducted separately one to two weeks apart. As a modelling approach, we employ a hybrid choice model. Our findings indicate that people strongly support an equity-based cost distribution and that those with a stronger equity-based distributive justice attitude are more willing to pay for air quality improvement programmes.",Air pollution; Choice experiment; Distributive justice attitude; Factorial survey experiment; Hybrid choice model; Willingness to pay,,ENVIRONMENTAL ATTITUDES; CHOICE MODELS; FAIRNESS; GENDER; PAY,WOS

Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated the adverse health effects of air pollution exposure based on modeled measures, but only a few have considered the health impact of perceived air quality. Improving our knowledge of individual perceptions is crucial to defining targeted actions and promoting appropriate intervention measures. Our objective is to investigate the relationship between subjective and objective measures of air pollution and to focus on how individual characteristics combined with the neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation index, measured at a fine spatial scale, may or may not alter this relationship. Materials and Methods: The subjective measures of air quality reported by a sample of Lyon residents were collected via an individual questionnaire. The objective measures of air pollution were modeled by the local air quality monitoring network of the Rhone-Alpes region at census block level. We used a socioeconomic deprivation index to capture the different socioeconomic dimensions at census block level. The statistical analysis was structured in two steps: (1) identification of individual determinants of the subjective measures of air quality using multiple correspondence analysis followed by hierarchical clustering; (2) identification of individual and contextual characteristics that may alter the relationship between the objective and subjective measures of air pollution. Results: Among the youngest and the middle aged population (ages 30 to 59), consistent results between level of satisfaction, perceived air quality and objective measures of air pollution were found whatever the individual characteristics of the population. It is less clear among the oldest population: globally no significant difference between the NO2 concentrations and the level of satisfaction was observed. Conclusions: We found a significant relationship between the subjective and objective measures of air pollution in many population sub-groups with different combinations of individual characteristics. The relationship is less clear among the oldest population, which confirms previous findings. Our finding highlights that age combined with low level of education and unemployment, or women or health problems as well as the neighborhood deprivation index influence the level of air quality satisfaction.",air pollution; perception; public health,,LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; ANNOYANCE SCORES; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; LUNG-CANCER; POLLUTION; MORTALITY; HEALTH; PERCEPTION; POLLUTANTS; BEHAVIOR,WOS

To address this question, we exploit an unexpected clash amongst the executive and judiciary in New Delhi, between survey waves, over exemptions for women in the context of the odd-even rule, a policy intervention to reduce air pollution from transportation. We find that public support for the contested policy was not undermined by the executive-judiciary clash. However, the clash polarised public opinion by gender, based upon the policy exemptions.

This paper investigates WTPA based on the perspective of subjective well-being (SWB) and analyzes the mediating role of social interaction on the relationship between the two. This paper distinguishes social interactions into online and offline interactions and analyzes whether the mediating effect of the two different interactions on SWB and WTPA exists separately. Using data from the 2018 China General Social Survey (CGSS), we find that SWB has a significant positive effect on WTPA, individuals with higher well-being have higher pro-environmental willingness; there is no age, education level, sex of the person, or regional heterogeneity in the effect of SWB on WTPA; offline social interactions play a partially mediating role between SWB and WTPA, while online social interactions failed to mediate between the two.

Improving the population's involvement in environmental and energy conservation necessitates understanding their motivation to behave under haze. Considering the social problems caused by haze conditions in China, this study used people's risk perception as a basis to determine their motivations to perform pro-environmental and energy-saving behaviors. We analyzed motivation from privately and publicly oriented perspectives as well as adaptive and mitigative behavioral viewpoints. Motivation-related data were collected through face-to-face discussion and a survey of 506 respondents in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area, which is one of the most heavily polluted regions in China. We conducted multiple regression analysis to determine the extent to which socio-demographic characteristics and risk perception concerning haze predict motivation and actual behavior. Results showed that these factors explain 36.8% and 30.5% of privately and publicly oriented motivations, respectively, but more strongly explain more adaptive (i.e., privately oriented; 55.0%) than mitigating (i.e., publicly oriented; 8.8%) behaviors. Although the residents are motivated to behave equally for private and public purposes in initial conservation efforts, they tend to exhibit adaptive behavior more frequently than mitigating behaviors. These results serve as a reference in encouraging China's residents to act pro-environmentally and use energy conservatively, thereby contributing to environmental and energy saving education for the society.",risk perception; motivation; behaviors; haze conditions; pro-environment; energy-saving,Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; adaptive management; energy conservation; energy use; environmental education; environmental planning; haze; multiple regression; nature-society relations; public attitude; risk perception,,WOS

Although China is an authoritarian country with strict media control, public opinion may still affect air quality by putting pressure on the local and central governments to enhance environmental protections. In this paper, the impact of public opinion on air quality in China is for the first time quantitatively examined. Specifically, the monthly average levels of the Air Quality Index (AQI) and the concentrations of several main air pollutants, such as PM2.5, PM10 and SO2, are utilized as indicators for air quality. Using a dataset consisting of 109 prefecture-level Chinese cities for the period between November 2013 and October 2016, the estimation results indicate that air pollution significantly affects public opinion on air quality, and the surge in public opinion on air pollution occurs more frequently in the winter.

The ventilation system function was researched simultaneously with IAQ measurements, with an analysis of total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), single volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and indoor mycobiota, and with questionnaires about perceived IAQ. At the baseline, an operational error of the ventilation system was found, which prevented the air from coming into the classrooms, except for short periods of high carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. After the ventilation operation was improved, a significant change in indoor mycobiota was found; the dominant, opportunistic human pathogenic species Trichoderma citrinoviride found in settled dust in the classroom before the improvement was no longer detected. In addition, the concentrations of CO2, TVOC, and some single VOCs, especially toluene and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, decreased. The analysis of the questionnaire results indicated that the perceptions of unpleasant odors and stuffy air decreased, although a statistically significant improvement in perceived IAQ was not observed. The results provided evidence that the properly controlled hybrid ventilation system operating in mechanical supply mode provided adequate ventilation and was effective in decreasing the concentrations of some indoor-generated pollutants. With simple ventilation adjustments, microbiological exposure from building structures might be prevented.",ventilation; hybrid ventilation; indoor air quality; mycobiota; indoor air questionnaire; school building; Trichoderma citrinoviride,,NEW-YORK-STATE; TRICHODERMA-LONGIBRACHIATUM; SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE; MAMMALIAN-CELLS; ENVIRONMENTS; HEALTH; PERFORMANCE; SYMPTOMS; WORK; PEPTAIBOLS,WOS

This study explored the directive's effects on the public's risk perceptions of haze in the country. Specifically, we identified public views regarding haze-related risks, the factors that influence their perceptions, and the changes in such perceptions by administering questionnaires to residents of implementation and non-implementation areas in Tianjin City before and after six months-regulation application in the metropolis. The panel data obtained from the survey were then subjected to difference-in-differences analysis. Surprisingly, the analysis showed that the directive significantly reduced the public's perceptions of risk, even when we controlled for factors related to knowledge, attitudes, health conditions, and expectations from government governance of air pollution. This finding suggested that the evaluation of other control measures that prohibit all construction-related activities during winter and the subsequent formulation of optimal solution and clarification as to what constitutes sustainable energy usage.

We aimed to investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to AP on lateral ventricles (LV) and corpus callosum (CC) volumes in children and to determine whether the induced brain changes are associated with behavioral problems. Methods: Among the children recruited through a set of representative schools of the city of Barcelona, (Spain) in the Brain Development and Air Pollution Ultrafine Particles in School Children (BREATHE) study, 186 typically developing participants aged 8-12 years underwent brain MRI on the same 1.5 T MR unit over a 1.5-year period (October 2012-April 2014). Brain volumes were derived from structural MRI scans using automated tissue segmentation. Behavioral problems were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the criteria of the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder DSM-IV list. Prenatal fine particle (PM2.5) levels were retrospectively estimated at the mothers' residential addresses during pregnancy with land use regression (LUR) models. To determine whether brain structures might be affected by prenatal PM2.5 exposure, linear regression models were run and adjusted for age, sex, intracranial volume (ICV), maternal education, home socioeconomic vulnerability index, birthweight and mothers' smoking status during pregnancy. To test for associations between brain changes and behavioral outcomes, negative binomial regressions were performed and adjusted for age, sex, ICV. Results: Prenatal PM2.5 levels ranged from 11.8 to 39.5 mu g/m(3) during the third trimester of pregnancy. An interquartile range increase in PM2.5 level (7 mu g/m(3)) was significantly linked to a decrease in the body CC volume (mm(3)) (beta = -53.7, 95%CI [-92.0, -15.5] corresponding to a 5% decrease of the mean body CC volume) independently of ICV, age, sex, maternal education, socioeconomic vulnerability index at home, birthweight and mothers smoking status during the third trimester of pregnancy. A 50 mm(3) decrease in the body CC was associated with a significant higher hyperactivity subscore (Rate Ratio (RR) = 1.09, 95%CI [1.01, 1.17) independently of age, sex and ICV.

Three primary schools with high pollution levels participated in environmental educational activities, including air quality workshops and field campaigns involving different methods, time schedules, and project scopes. Participants completed surveys before and after these activities to measure their understanding, perceptions, and behavior. After the workshops, students admitted feeling more skillful in monitoring air quality and confident in incorporating this education into daily life and teaching others. They shared their results with peers, school leadership, and the community and led campaigns to help design experiments, choose measurement locations, and reduce air pollution exposure in schools. The results showed increased concern about air pollution, a better understanding of its causes and impacts, and more reported reduction behaviors. An Air Pollution Exposure Index (APEI) was combined with participatory monitoring data to raise awareness and understanding among students on typical school-day exposure. Feedback indicates that the tool was useful in defining air pollution exposure status and identifying exposure risks.

The investigation included comparative assessment of 217 green-certified Minergie (M) and 433 energy-renovated (R) dwellings. Data were collected through a combination of questionnaire survey of building characteristics and occupancy symptoms/satisfaction, as well as field measurements of radon, total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), formaldehyde and fungi. The results showed that 90% of M dwellings relied on renewable and low-carbon energy sources for space and water heating, as compared to only 40% of R dwellings. The annual electricity consumptions of M and R dwellings were similar (similar to 33 kWh/m(2)), however, R dwellings consumed more gas and heating oil, thus contributing more to greenhouse gas emissions. Concentration of sampled air pollutants in the two dwelling types was generally below the maximum guideline values. Interestingly, concentration of all air pollutants was significantly lower in M relative to R dwellings: Radon (48 vs. 91 Bq/m(3)), TVOC (167 vs. 259 mu g/m(3)), formaldehyde (12 vs. 15 mu g/m(3)) and fungal colony forming units (33 vs. 48 CFUs). Statistical comparisons revealed that residents of naturally ventilated R dwellings tended to open window more frequently, while occupants of M dwellings relied on mechanical ventilation. We found no differences in occupant satisfaction and self-reported symptoms between the two dwelling types.

The research model is based on task-technology fit (TTF) and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) concepts. A comprehensive BDA-EAP management system is proposed and the potential adoption speed of such a system evaluated by sending structured questionnaires to the employees of relevant environmental agencies, yielding 412 valid responses, using the structural equation modeling approach. The results of the study predict that factors of TTF including task characteristics and technology characteristics are strong influencers of TTF, and TTF is a strong predictor of the behavioral intention of users to adopt a BDA-EAP management system. The results demonstrated that the combination of TTF and UTAUT is a stronger predictor of behavioral intention than either TTF or UTAUT alone. Furthermore, resistance to change negatively moderates and extrinsic motivation positively moderates the significant positive relationship between behavioral intention and adoption of a BDA-EAP management system. Meanwhile, behavioral intention, resistance to change, and extrinsic motivation have a significant three-way interaction impact on adoption of a BDA-EAP management system such that an increase in users? extrinsic motivation will decrease the negative impact of resistance to change during the process of adoption.

Setting: While air quality in Minnesota currently meets federal standards, urban communities are concerned about the impact of air pollution on their health. The Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St Paul) metropolitan area includes 7 counties where fine particulate levels and rates of asthma exacerbations are elevated in some communities. Design: We used the Environmental Protection Agency's BenMAP (Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program) software, along with local PM2.5 (fine particulate) and ozone ambient concentrations, census and population health data, to calculate impacts for 2008 at the zip code level. The impacts were summed across all zip codes for area-wide estimates. American Community Survey data were used to stratify zip codes by poverty and race for assessment of disparities. Main Outcome Measures: Attributable fraction, attributable rate and counts for all-cause mortality, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hospitalizations, asthma emergency department (ED) visits, and cardiovascular disease hospitalizations. Results: In the Twin Cities (2008), air pollution was a contributing cause for an estimated 2% to 5% of respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations and ED visits and between 6% and 13% of premature deaths. The elderly (aged 65+ years) experienced the highest air pollution-attributable rates of death and respiratory hospitalizations; children experienced the highest asthma ED visit rates. Geographical and demographic differences in air pollution-attributable health impacts across the region reflected the differences in the underlying morbidity and mortality rates. Conclusions: Method was effective in demonstrating that changes in air quality can have quantifiable health impacts across the Twin Cities.

Water boiling and cooking experiments using the common cooking energy sources (fuel wood, kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and electricity) and common food items (water, yam and beans) were carried out. Energy surveys were carried out to determine the cooking energy use patterns in the urban and rural areas. It was found that fuel wood is the least expensive cooking energy source and LPG is the most expensive. Energy use efficiencies for boiling water were estimated at 25%, 46%, 73%, 79%, 66% and 90% for fuel wood, kerosene, gas, electric immersion coil, electric heating coil and electric hot plate, respectively. Energy intensity was found to be a comparative measure of energy efficiency. The impacts of air pollution from household cooking suggested a possibility of significant air pollutants contribution to the ambient environment using any of the energy carriers considered except electricity. The cooking energy use patterns showed that fuel wood is the predominant energy source for cooking in the rural areas while kerosene is the predominant energy source in the urban areas, revealing that the energy policy in the country had made no impact in the cooking energy sector.

Multiple challenges have been documented to the improvement of IAQ standards in HEIs. However, an alternative to the management of IAQ is possible through environmental behavioral change. Research Methodology: A philosophical stance of post-positivism influences the adoption of a quantitative research approach for this study. Primary data on the views shared by various academic and administrative staff employed by HEIs across South Africa were collected using a closed-ended questionnaire survey. A literature review uncovered 16 influential environmental policy adoption enablers that could further the objective of the study. A four-phase data analytical approach was adopted to interpret the empirical data through screening and reliability assessment, together with descriptive and inferential statistical evaluations, to ascertain the influence held by the surveyed policy adoption enablers on improving the management of IAQ in HEIs. Results: The inferential statistical evaluation using exploratory factor analysis revealed three crucial environmental policy adoption metrical approaches (stakeholder dialogue, institutional commitment, and policy composition) to the management of IAQ in HEIs. Discussion: From a practical perspective, the administrative council of HEIs could consider the identified policy adoption enablers as a catalyst for pro-environmental behavior and the management of IAQ in all respective institutions. Theoretically, this study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing factors associated with environmental policy adoptions for IAQ management and laying the groundwork for future research in environmental behavior, this has been lacking in previous IAQ studies and current environmental management discourse. As an instrumental enabler, the identified policy adoption approaches could inform any existing or new institutional policy adoption initiative aimed at improving current individuals’ perception of workplace comfort, satisfaction, and performance directly associated with their indoor environmental conditions.

Regulating resident's PM2.5 reduction behaviors related to vehicle use is an effective measure for PM2.5 emission control. The present study focuses on two types of resident vehicular PM2.5 reduction behaviors (taking public transportation and purchasing electric vehicles) and examines their key predictors and influencing mechanism based on the extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The data was collected from Chinese urban residents who lived in heavy haze areas. The results indicated that attitude, subjective norm and moral norm have positive effects on each vehicular PM2.5 reduction intention. It was highlighted that the differentiated perceived behavioral control components (self-efficacy and perceived control) and their moderating effects were inconsistent across two behaviors. Regarding to the behavior of taking public transportation, self-efficacy affected the intention positively and directly, while perceived control affected intention indirectly by moderating the relationship between subjective norm and intention. For purchasing electric vehicles, self-efficacy and perceived control didn't affect intention directly. Instead, self-efficacy moderated the relationship between moral norm and intention, and perceived control moderated the relationship between subjective norm and intention. The results confirm the appropriateness of the extended TPB model in predicting resident intentions to participate in vehicular PM2.5 reduction behaviors.

227,10.13284/j.cnki.rddl.003300,Exposure characteristics and residents' perception of air pollution in neighborhood parks: The case of the Guangzhou Central Urban Area; [社区公园空气污染暴露特征及其居民感知:以广州市中心城区为例],Wenyue Y.; Xin L.; Yingmei M.; Huiling C.,2021,,41.0,1,"Neighborhood parks are green spaces where nearby residents can have their recreational activities. However, in many cases, land use planning and park design do not consider the relationship between the park location, its shape and size, and distance to the main road, traffic, and air pollution, which may expose residents using the park to the risks of air pollution. Meanwhile, existing research has paid less attention to the air pollution of green park spaces, especially at the neighborhood level. Based on air pollution monitoring and survey data, this study explored the spatial characteristics of air pollution in 33 neighborhood parks in the central urban area of Guangzhou, China, as well as the influencing factors, and residents' perception of air pollution when using the neighborhood park. The main conclusions are the following: 1) The air pollution exposure risks and their spatial pattern distribution in neighborhood parks in various districts are quite different, and the proportion of parks with low exposure risk is relatively small; 2) the Air Quality Index (AQI), PM1.0, and PM10 are significantly negatively associated with the area of neighborhood parks, while AQI, PM1.0, PM10, and PM2.5 are significantly positively associated with the patch shape index. In addition, the carbon dioxide (CO2) index is significantly negatively associated only with the distance from the urban main roads. However, there is almost no correlation between primary and secondary road density within the 1 km buffer zone of the neighborhood boundary and the degree of air pollution. 3) More than one-third of the residents' subjective perception of the air pollution level is better than the objective measurement, which indicates that they overestimated the air quality of the neighborhood park. This may have possibly led them to more exposure to the bad air environment when they do some physical activities there. When there are possible traffic pollution sources around neighborhood parks, residents' subjective perceptions of air quality are low. 4) Alternative activity spaces and accessibility of neighborhood parks affect the risk of residents' exposure to air pollution. If there is no alternative activity space around the residence, or the nearest neighborhood park is more accessible, residents would be more inclined to head to the neighborhood park for physical activity, even if they perceive the risk of air pollution exposure. In addition, this study has some policy insights. Neighborhood parks can help to suppress the diffusion of particulate matter, but most of them are small and have limited effects on mitigating traffic air pollution. To maximize the ecological service function of neighborhood parks and their role in air pollution purification, neighborhood parks covering larger areas, having higher accessibility and fuller shapes, and being far away from main traffic roads should be promoted. It is necessary to implement targeted space optimization and air pollution control strategies, such as control traffic around neighborhood parks with more serious air pollution; increase protective green spaces, the number of street trees, and road greening; optimize building planning and layout; and improve non-motorized travel environments. © 2021 Editorial Committee of Tropical Geography.

This study proposes a model to explicate how people's online news exposure, perceived risk, and perceived news credibility influence their trust in regulators concerning the issue of air pollution in China. An online survey showed that perceived risk fully mediated the relationship between online news exposure and trust in regulators. Through moderating the association between online news exposure and perceived risk, perceived news credibility also moderated the indirect effect: the negative indirect effect of online news exposure on trust in regulators via perceived risk was stronger when the level of perceived news credibility was high than when it was low. The results suggest that online news that attempts to make the public more conscious of air pollution hazards reduces public trust in regulators, especially when people perceive the news as highly credible. News media are supposed to inform the public of the issue and thus help air pollution management. However, the findings alert us that the amplification of public risk perception resulting from frequent online news exposure and the subsequent decline in public trust in regulators might impede the effective regulation of air pollution.",Online news exposure; perceived risk; perceived news credibility; trust in regulators; air pollution,,,WOS

In traditional exposure research, air pollution and noise are monitored with stationary measurement devices or based on models. During the last years, mobile measurement techniques with GPS-tracking have increased. Moreover, studies have investigated another dimension of personal exposure: the perceived exposure. Aim: Most of these studies make use of quantitative methods such as surveys, complemented by stationary or wearable sensors. Little research exist that applies qualitative methods to examine how people experience and perceive exposure on-the-move, contrasting it to actual measurements. The aim of this paper is to discuss the potential of a novel method, which extends the dimensions of personal exposure by including the situational context of exposure perception. Methods/case study: Firstly, different methods for exposure research are presented. Secondly, we introduce a novel mixed-method approach, exploring cyclists and pedestrians perceived and measured exposure on-the-move by combining mobile interviews (Go-/Ride-Alongs) and wearable sensors. We will present the methodological findings using a case study and have a quantitative method (smartphone questionnaire, wearable sensors) as a reference. Results and discussion: The differences of perceived and measured exposure, proven through the reference method, are a result of different situational contexts as shown by the mobile interviews (knowledge, embodied experience, life situation, activities). The methodological findings show, that mobile methods complemented by wearables introduce new dimensions of personal exposure: they shed light on the situational contexts that affect exposure perception during commute. Conclusion: We argue that both, perceived and measured exposure to air pollution and noise, need to be considered simultaneously. Complementing mobile interviews or surveys with wearable sensor data improves the understanding of urban dwellers requirements for healthier mobility. Potentials of these methods should be investigated further, both in research and for supporting urban transport planning decisions adapted to people's needs.",Mobile interview; Wearable sensors; Mixed-methods; Air pollution; Noise; Perception,atmospheric pollution; GPS; noise pollution; perception; pollution exposure; sensor; traffic emission; urban transport,PARTICULATE MATTER; WEARABLE SENSORS; HEALTH; PERCEPTION; EXPERIENCE; WALKING; CITY; NEIGHBORHOOD; INFORMATION; ANNOYANCE,WOS

Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was used. Data were collected from 150 voluntary older adult participants from Songpa-gu in Seoul. The survey questions measured service perception and experience related to PM, risk perception related to PM, attitude toward risk of PM, and health behavior related to PM. Results: The average score for health behavior related to PM was 79.37, ranging from 51 to 115. There was a significant positive correlation between health behavior related to PM and risk perception related to PM (r=.58, p<.001) as well as between health behavior related to PM and attitude toward risk of PM (r=.70, p<.001). Multiple linear regression revealed that health behavior related to PM was predicted by levels of the existence of disease related to PM (beta=.14, p=.019), service experience related to PM (beta=.20, p=.021), risk perception related to PM (beta=.20, p=.019), and attitude toward risk of PM (beta=.44, p<.001). The model including these variables accounted for 47.0% of health behavior related to PM. Conclusion: Korean older adults have the low level of health behavior related to PM. The findings of this study emphasize that risk perception and attitude toward risk of PM should be evaluated, and the underlying diseases related to PM and their service experience should be considered in developing intervention to improve health behavior related to PM.",Aged; Particulate Matter; Health Behavior; Perception; Attitude,,TERM EXPOSURE; AIR-POLLUTION; MORTALITY; RISK; ATTITUDES; LITERACY; MODEL,WOS

Exposure to haze is linked to ophthalmic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and mortality. In this study, we investigated the role of demographic factors, knowledge and perceived risk in influencing protective behaviours during the 2013 haze in Singapore. Methods: We evaluated 696 adults in a cross-sectional study. Participants were sampled via a 2-stage simple random sampling without replacement from a large residential district in Singapore in 2015. The questionnaire measured the participant's knowledge, perceived risk and behaviours during the Southeast Asian haze crisis in 2013. Reliability and validity of the questionnaire were assessed using comparative fit index (>= 0.96) and root mean square error of approximation (<= 0.05). We performed structural equation modelling to examine the relationship between the hypothesised factors and protective behaviours. Results: More than 95% of the individuals engaged in at least 1 form of protective behaviour. Knowledge was strongly associated with protective behaviours via direct effect (beta=0.45, 95% CI 0.19-0.69, P<0.001) and indirect effect through perceived risk (beta=0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.31, P= 0.002). Perceived risk was associated with protective behaviours (beta=0.28, 95% CI:0.11-0.44, P=0.002). A lower household income and ethnic minority were associated with protective behaviours. A lower education level and smokers were associated with lower knowledge of haze. A higher education and ethnic minority were associated with a lower perceived risk. Wearing of N95 masks was associated with other haze-related protective behaviours (beta= 0.24, 95% CI 0.08-0.37, P=0.001). Conclusion: Knowledge was associated with protective behaviours, suggesting the importance of public education. Efforts should target those of lower education level and smokers.

In particular, the effects of air pollution on children's neurobehavioral development have attracted widespread attention. Moreover, the early detection of a sensitive period is very important for the precise intervention of the disease. However, such studies focusing on hyperactive behaviors and susceptible window identification are currently lacking in China. Objectives: The study aims to explore the correlation between air pollution exposure and hyperactive behaviors during the early life stage and attempt to identify whether a susceptible exposure window exists that is crucial for further precise intervention. Methods: Based on the Longhua Child Cohort Study, we collected the basic information and hyperactivity index of 26,052 children using a questionnaire conducted from 2015 to 2017, and the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-revised (CPRS-48) was used to assess hyperactive behaviors. Moreover, the data of air pollution concentration (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, CO, O-3 and SO2) were collected from the monitoring station between 2011 to 2017, and a land-use random forest model was used to evaluate the exposure level of each subject. Furthermore, Distributed lag non-linear models (DLNMs) were applied for statistic analysis. Results: The risk of child hyperactivity was found to be positively associated with early life exposure to PM10, PM2.5 and NO2. In particular, for an increase of per 10 mu g/m(3) in PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 exposure concentration during early life, the risk of child hyperactivity increased significantly during the seventh month of pregnancy to the fourth month after birth, with the strongest association in the ninth month of pregnancy (PM10: OR = 1.043, 95% CI: 1.016-1.071; PM2.5: OR = 1.062, 95% CI: 1.024-1.102; NO2: OR = 1.043, 95% CI: 1.016-1.071). However, no significant associations among early life exposure to CO, O-3 and SO2 and child hyperactive behaviors were observed. Conclusions: Early life exposure to PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 is associated with an increased risk of child ADHD-like behaviors at the age around 3 years, and the late-prenatal and early postnatal periods might be the susceptible exposure windows.",fetal exposure; air pollution; ADHD-like behavior,,DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; LAND-USE REGRESSION; POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; REVISED CONNERS PARENT; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; PARTICULATE MATTER; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SCHOOL,WOS

Surprisingly, there have been no studies of the differences in the public's willingness to pay (WTP) for haze governance within a province. Yet haze reduction policies are implemented at the provincial level. Based on the contingent valuation method, data on WTP for haze governance across four industrial cities in Shandong province were collected using a questionnaire survey. Method: A combination of stratified sampling and non-probability sampling methods were used, yielding a valid sample of 1006 respondents. The Heckman sample selection model was used to analyze factors determining WTP and WTP amount. Results: 53% of respondents were unwilling to pay for haze reduction, while less than 1% of these respondents were satisfied with Shandong's air quality. About half (47%) of the respondents were willing to pay, on average, US$14.14 per household per year for haze governance. We found that there were significant inter-city differences in the WTP and WTP amounts: those with a higher income, education, haze knowledge, and haze concern were WTP; age, marital status, and subjective indicators displayed a negative relationship with WTP amount. About two thirds of the non-payers, and those with poor environmental knowledge, argued that air quality improvement was mainly the responsibility of governments (39.3%) and polluters (25.6%), instead of ordinary citizens. Further, 27% of non-payers said that their income was too low to contribute to a pollution tax and 6.3% claimed that they did not believe the funds would be used effectively for environmental conservation. Conclusions: City-specific differences in WTP may caution against one size fits all policies. The study indicates that the government may need to target policies to specific cities and the characteristics of residents in those cities by age, education, and income groups and residents' subjective evaluation of the government and the haze problem and those responsible for pollution.",contingent valuation method; willingness to pay; haze governance; Shandong province,,CONTINGENT VALUATION; AIR-POLLUTION; RIVER DELTA; QUALITY; MORTALITY; SYSTEM,WOS

Methods From June 2015 to April 2016 1 025 adolescents were selected from 22 classes in two middle schools of Baoding City Hebei Province by stratified cluster sampling method. General information questionnaire and the Brief Haze Weather Health Protection Behavior Assessment Scale-Adolescent Version BHWHPBAS-AV were used. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to explore factors affecting adolescent haze weather health protection behavior. Different models were used to confirm associations between influencing factors and BHWHPBAS-AV scores. Results Adolescents had a low overall score of BHWHPBAS-AV 45. 81 ± 13. 16. The score rate of self-adjustment after haze weather was the highest 64.54%. The score rate of obtaining relevant knowledge before haze weather was the lowest 50.28%. Compared with adolescents in urban area rural adolescents had a lower BHWHPBAS-AV score β = - 3.20 P < 0.01. Compared with students living with parents those living without parents had a lower BHWHPBAS-AV score β = - 4.16 P = 0.01. Compared with students never receive physical examination those had received physical examination during the past years had a higher BHWHPBAS-AV score β = 4.44 5.66 9.04 P<0.01. Compared with students with no knowledge of respiratory system diseases those with moderate to sufficient knowledge had a higher BHWHPBAS-AV score β = 9.34 12.19 P<0.01. These associations were stable and consistent.Multiple linear regression analysis showed that residence residence with parents physical examination and knowledge of respiratory diseases were the relevant factors of BHWHPBAS-AV score P < 0. 05. Conclusion Adolescent haze weather health protection behavior level is low and is affected by many factors. Cooperation should be strengthened to conduct behavioral interventions and health guidance on haze health protection for adolescents so as to promote healthy growth of adolescents. © 2022 Journal Office of Chinese School Health(Bengbu).

However, owing to lack of suitable data, less research has focused on why people have higher or lower WTP for environmental protection, and many questions about their reasons remain unanswered. Based on contingent valuation questionnaires in 16 districts of Shanghai, this study investigates the influencing factors of residentso WTP for haze mitigation. To avoid a multicollinearity problem, we integrate principal component analysis and the probit model to examine the determinants of WTP. Results show that residentso WTP for haze mitigation ranges from 343.31 to 359.48 USD. The major influencing factors of residentso WTP include subjective knowledge of haze impacts, understanding of the frequency and severity of haze, and social trust in haze data published by the government. In particular, we find that owing to anti-haze household expenditure on mitigating the effects of haze pollution on health, residents who considered that the areas they lived in were more influenced by haze pollution do not always have higher WTP for haze mitigation. Results of this study have policy implications for haze mitigation regarding the effect of anti-haze household expenditure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The health effects associated with air pollution are not just a matter of epidemiology and environmental science research, but also an important social science issue. Literature about the relationship of socioeconomic factors with the environment and health factors is inadequate. The relationship between air pollution exposure and health effects in China was investigated with consideration of the socioeconomic factors. Methods: Based on nationwide survey data of China in 2014, we applied the multilevel mixed-effects model to evaluate how socioeconomic status (represented by education and income) contributed to the relationship between self-rated air pollution and self-rated health status at community level and individual level. Results: The findings indicated that there was a non-linear relationship between the community socioeconomic status and community air pollution in urban China, with the highest level of air pollution presented in the communities with moderate socioeconomic status. In addition, health effects associated air pollution in different socioeconomic status groups were not equal. Self-rated air pollution had the greatest impact on self-rated health of the lower socioeconomic groups. With the increase of socioeconomic status, the effect of self-rated air pollution on self-rated health decreased. Conclusions: This study verified the different levels of exposure to air pollution and inequality in health effects among different socioeconomic groups in China.

This paper takes the congestion charge policy in China, targeted at smog and traffic control, and checks how smog awareness-including smog concerns and perceived smog risks, besides behavioral and policy-related factors-might influence public acceptance of the policy. In this paper, we found both a direct and moderating causal relationship between smog awareness and public acceptance. Based on a sample of 574 valid questionnaires in Beijing and Shanghai in 2016, an ordered logistic regression modeling approach was used to delineate the causality between smog awareness and public acceptance. We found that both smog concerns, such as perceived smog risk, and willingness to pay (WTP) were both directly and indirectly positively correlated with public acceptance. These findings imply that policymakers should increase policy fairness with environmental-oriented policy design and should express potential policy effectiveness of the smog controlling policy to citizens to increase their acceptance level.",sustainable development; smog concerns; perceived smog risks; public acceptance; congestion charge,Beijing [China]; China; Shanghai; congestion; environmental policy; environmental risk; policy making; pollution control; public attitude; regression analysis; smog; sustainable development; willingness to pay,WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; POLITICAL TRUST; ENVIRONMENTAL TAXATION; AIR-POLLUTION; ATTITUDES; PERCEPTIONS; CHINA; DETERMINANTS; PERSPECTIVE; KNOWLEDGE,WOS

To investigate how Chinese people's exposure to health information on social media influenced their health protective behaviors in response to haze, particularly wearing a PM2.5 anti-haze mask, we conducted a longitudinal web-based survey of mainland Chinese. The results from the structural equation modeling showed that (a) attitude and descriptive norm positively mediated the relationships between using Weibo for health information and behavioral intention while descriptive norm negatively mediated the relationship between using WeChat for health information and intention, and that (b) attitude, descriptive norm, and injunctive norm significantly predicted behavioral intention and wearing mask, but perceived behavior control did not.

29,10.1007/s11625-021-01038-2,How do we effectively communicate air pollution to change public attitudes and behaviours? A review,Riley R.; de Preux L.; Capella P.; Mejia C.; Kajikawa Y.; de Nazelle A.,2021,,16.0,6,"Solutions that engage the public are needed to tackle air pollution. Technological approaches are insufficient to bring urban air quality to recommended target levels, and miss out on opportunities to promote health more holistically through behavioural solutions, such as active travel. Behaviour change is not straightforward, however, and is more likely to be achieved when communication campaigns are based on established theory and evidence-based practices. We systematically reviewed the academic literature on air pollution communication campaigns aimed at influencing air pollution-related behaviour. Based on these findings, we developed an evidence-based framework for stimulating behaviour change through engagement. Across the 37 studies selected for analyses, we identified 28 different behaviours assessed using a variety of designs including natural and research-manipulated experiments, cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys and focus groups. While avoidance behaviour (e.g. reducing outdoor activity) followed by contributing behaviours (e.g. reducing idling) were by far the most commonly studied, supporting behaviour (e.g. civil engagement) shows promising results, with the added benefit that supporting local and national policies may eventually lead to the removal of social and physical barriers that prevent wider behavioural changes. Providing a range of actionable information will reduce disengagement due to feelings of powerlessness. Targeted localized information will appear more immediate and engaging, and positive framing will prevent cognitive dissonance whereby people rationalize their behaviour to avoid living with feelings of unease. Communicating the co-benefits of action may persuade individuals with different drivers but as an effective solution, it remains to be explored. Generally, finding ways to connect with people’s emotions, including activating social norms and identities and creating a sense of collective responsibility, provide promising yet under-explored directions. Smartphones provide unique opportunities that enable flexible and targeted engagement, but care must be taken to avoid transferring responsibility for action from national and local authorities onto individuals. Multidisciplinary teams involving artists, members of the public, community and pressure groups, policy makers, researchers, and businesses, are needed to co-create the stories and tools that can lead to effective action to tackle air pollution through behavioural solutions. © 2021, The Author(s).",Air quality; Campaign; Communication; Engagement; Information role,,,Scopus

Evidence from Beijing,"Zhao, PJ; Li, SX; Li, PL; Liu, JX; Long, KF",2018,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT,63.0,,"It is widely believed air pollution is an obstacle to cycling as it has negative effects on cyclists' health outcomes and deteriorates their cycling experiences. However, the empirical studies investigating the impact of air pollution on cycling behaviour remains scarce. The aim of this paper is to fill the gap by looking at Beijing as a case study. The authors conducted a survey of 307 cyclists on the days with different levels of air quality in terms of concentration of PM2.5 in 2015. The results show that in the polluted weather, those who persist in cycling are more likely to be male, over 30 years old, lower income or those who travel short distances. Specifically, female cyclists have a higher tendency to shift from cycling to public transit than the males and medium and high-income earners are more likely to shift to using a car than low income earners. The residents' subjective perceptions of safety and comfort have major effects on their cycling behaviour. A higher perception of comfort and safety is related to a higher possibility of continuing cycling when air quality became polluted. Cycling for commuting trips is less likely to be replaced by other modes than cycling for non-commuting trips, such as shopping. Results of this study reveal that improving air quality in a metropolitan area such as Beijing has co-benefits of cycling renaissance. The huge investments into cycling infrastructure should be integrated with policies designed to create an attractive environment for cycling.",Cycling; Air pollution; Psychological perceptions; Environment; Beijing,Beijing [China]; China; Investments; Beijing; Case-studies; Cycling; Cycling behavior; Empirical studies; Environment; Health outcomes; Low incomes; PM 2.5; Psychological perception; air quality; atmospheric pollution; behavioral response; commuting; cycle transport; metropolitan area; perception; psychology; public transport; Air quality,PERSONAL EXPOSURE; PARTICULATE MATTER; TRANSPORT MICROENVIRONMENTS; WEATHER CONDITIONS; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; TRAVEL BEHAVIOR; URBAN FORM; PM2.5; BICYCLE; CHOICE,WOS

These issues are especially acute in environmental justice (EJ) communities where schools are located in polluted areas. This community-based participatory research examines how IAQ in naturally ventilated school buildings is affected by the use of air purifiers, air change rates, outdoor pollution levels, and teacher and staff behavior.Methods IAQ assessments were performed at two schools in Detroit, Michigan, which included building walk-through inspections and continuous indoor and outdoor measurements of black carbon (BC), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), carbon dioxide (CO2), air change rates (ACRs), temperature, humidity, and sound pressure levels. Air purifiers with usage monitors were then installed, and the IAQ assessments were repeated. Teachers were surveyed before and after purifier deployment.Results At baseline, classrooms had low ACRs (0.58-1.38 h-1), moderate PM2.5 levels (2.8-8.9 mu g/m3), highly variable PM10 concentrations (4.7-37.5 mu g/m3), and elevated BC levels (0.3-0.7 mu g/m3), reflecting emissions from local traffic, industry and other sources. The installation and use of purifiers reduced pollutant levels and the overall performance matched the predictions of a single compartment model. However, daily reductions varied widely among classrooms, reflecting differences in teacher behavior regarding the frequency of opening windows and the operation of purifiers, including differences in purifier fan speed settings and whether purifiers were used at night. Survey responses indicated that many teachers were aware of IAQ problems. The higher rates reported for health symptoms and dissatisfaction at one school may have lowered the teachers' tolerance to noise and reduced purifier use.Discussion The study helps explain the variation reported in prior studies using purifiers, and it reinforces the need to monitor IAQ and purifier use, use enhanced filtration and increase ventilation, and engage with teachers and school staff to support and maintain IAQ programs in schools.",indoor air quality (IAQ); environmental justice (EJ); school; air purifier; particulate matter; teacher's behavior,,PARTICULATE MATTER; CO2 CONCENTRATIONS; PUBLIC-SCHOOLS; EXPOSURES; CLASSROOM; MICHIGAN; HEALTH; ASTHMA; IMPACT; ASSOCIATIONS,WOS

This is the first study in the medical literature reporting the acute physical and psychological symptoms of the general population during a haze crisis. We evaluated the factors that are associated with psychological stress of haze exposure. Methods: This study was conducted between June 21 to June 26, 2013. Participants were recruited by an online recruitment post and snowball sampling techniques. Participants were required to complete an online survey which was composed of demographics questionnaire, physical symptom checklist, perceived dangerous Pollutant Standard Index (PSI) value and views on the N-95 mask and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Results: A total of 298 participants returned the completed study questionnaire. The respondents reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (S. D. = 2.6). The five most common physical symptoms include mouth or throat discomfort (68.8%), nose discomfort (64.1%), eye discomfort (60.7%), headache (50.3%) and breathing difficulty (40.3%). The total IES-R score was 18.47 (S. D. = 11.69) which indicated that the study population experienced mild psychological stress but not to the extent of acute stress reaction syndrome. The perceived dangerous PSI level and number of physical symptoms were significantly associated with the mean intrusion score, mean hyper-arousal score, total mean IES-R score and total IES-R score (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a haze crisis is associated with acute physical symptoms and mild psychological stress.

In recent years, the rapid development and expansion of low-cost air quality sensors by companies such as PurpleAir has enabled an understanding of air pollution at a much higher spatiotemporal resolution compared to traditional monitoring networks. In this study, real-time PM2.5 measurements from 751 PurpleAir sensors operating from June to July in 2019 and 2020 were used to examine the impact of 4th of July fireworks on hourly and daily PM2.5 concentrations at the census tract and county levels in California. American Community Survey (ACS) and CalEnviroScreen 3.0 data were used to identify correlations between PM2.5 measurements and socioeconomic status (SES). A two-step method was implemented to assure the quality of raw PM2.5 sensor data and sensor calibration against co-located reference instruments. The results showed that over 67% and 81% of counties experienced immediate impacts related to fireworks in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Relative to 2019, the peak PM2.5 concentrations on July 4th and 5th 2020 were, on average, over 50% higher in California, likely due to the COVID-19-related increase in the use of household-level fireworks. This increase was most pronounced in southern counties, which tend to have less strict firework-related regulations and a greater use of illegal fireworks. Los Angeles County experienced the highest July 4th daily PM2.5 levels both in 2019 (29.9 mu g center dot m(-3)) and 2020 (42.6 mu g center dot m(-3)). Spatial hot spot analyses generally showed these southern counties (e.g., Los Angeles County) to be regional air pollution hotspots, whereas the opposite pattern was seen in the north (e.g., San Francisco). The results also showed PM2.5 peaks that were over two-times higher among communities with lower SES, higher minority group populations, and higher asthma rates. Our findings highlight the important role that policy and enforcement can play in reducing firework-related air pollution and protecting public health, as exemplified by southern California, where policy was more relaxed and air pollution was higher (especially in 2020 when the 4th of July coincided with the COVID-19-lockdown period), and in disadvantaged communities where disparities were greatest.",air quality; firework; particulate matter; low-cost sensors; PurpleAir; Independence Day,,AIR-POLLUTION; LOW-COST; PARTICULATE MATTER; SUBMICRON PARTICLES; FINE PARTICULATE; FIELD-EVALUATION; SHORT-TERM; COVID-19; QUALITY; HEALTH,WOS

Utilizing data from Chinese societal surveys, the research investigates the impact of air pollution perception on environmental governance satisfaction, as well as how this relationship is mediated by environmental tax and moderated by government trust. The findings reveal a strong inverse correlation between air pollution perception and satisfaction with environmental governance, highlighting the direct impact of environmental challenges on ESG outcomes. The relationship is nuanced by regional and demographic variations, highlighting the diverse impact of air pollution perception across different segments of society. The study also reveals the pivotal role of environmental tax in mediating this relationship, suggesting that tax policies can effectively enhance ESG strategies. Additionally, government trust is identified as a key moderating factor, underscoring the importance of trust in governance for the effectiveness of ESG practices. This research contributes to the broader field of air pollution perception and environmental governance, providing valuable insights into the complex interplay between public perception, tax policy, and trust in government.

This study examines the impact of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution on health behaviors among college students in Beijing, China. Study design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Health surveys were repeatedly administered among 12,000 newly admitted students at Tsinghua University during 2012-2015 over their freshman year. Linear individual fixed-effect regressions were performed to estimate the impacts of ambient PM2.5 concentration on health behaviors among survey participants, adjusting for various time-variant individual characteristics and environmental measures. Results: Ambient PM2.5 concentration was found to be negatively associated with time spent on walking, vigorous physical activity and sedentary behavior in the last week, but positively associated with time spent on nighttime/daytime sleep among survey participants. An increase in the ambient PM2.5 concentration by one standard deviation (36.5 mg/m(3)) was associated with a reduction in weekly total minutes of walking by 7.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.3-9.4), a reduction in weekly total minutes of vigorous physical activity by 10.1 (95% CI = 8.5-11.7), a reduction in daily average hours of sedentary behavior by 0.06 (95% CI = 0.02-0.10) but an increase in daily average hours of nighttime/daytime sleep by 1.07 (95% CI = 1.04-1.11). Conclusions: Ambient PM2.5 air pollution was inversely associated with physical activity level but positively associated with sleep duration among college students.

A disaggregate model including multiple factors such as air pollution levels and public transport quality was established. Travel mode preferences of private car owners of different sexes were analyzed. The results show that with the increase of air pollution degree, the rate of travel by private cars will decrease while the rate of travel by public transportation will increase. When air quality index is more than 200, the rate of travel by private cars will decrease rapidly while the rate of travel by public transportation will increase rapidly. The improvement in the public transportation service will effectively make the private car owners to abandon the private cars and choose public transportation, especially for women.

To verify the feasibility and validity of industrial energy-saving and emission-reduction polices in-the action plan, we conducted a cost-benefit analysis of implementing these policies in 31 provinces for the period of 2013 to 2017. We also completed a scenario analysis in, this study to assess the cost-effectiveness of different measures within the energy-saving and the emission-reduction policies individually. The data were derived from field surveys, statistical yearbooks, government documents, and published literatures. The results show that total cost and total benefit are 118.39 and 748.15 billion Yuan, respectively, and the estimated benefit-cost ratio is 632 in the S3 scenario. For all the scenarios, these policies are cost-effective and the eastern region has higher satisfactory values. Furthermore, the end-of-pipe scenario has greater emission reduction potential than energy-saving scenario. We also found that gross domestic product and population are significantly correlated with the benefit-cost ratio value through the regression analysis of selected possible influencing factors. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that benefit-cost ratio value is more sensitive to unit emission-reduction cost, unit subsidy, growth rate of gross domestic product, and discount rate among all the parameters. Compared with other provinces, the benefit-cost ratios of Beijing and Tianjin are more sensitive to changes of unit subsidy than unit emission-reduction cost.

What impact does the Internet have on people's perception of pollution? This study evaluates the causal effect of the Internet usage on the perception of air pollution by scrutinizing data from the China General Social Survey 2013. The results indicate that people who rely more heavily on the Internet for information perceive more severe pollution. This amplification effect cannot be attributed to the contextual factors including economic development or pollution severity through increasing the usage of the Internet. This study concludes with an exploratory mechanism analysis which demonstrates that people acquire greater environmental knowledge by using the Internet which serves to raise the awareness and amplify the perceived seriousness of air pollution.,Internet usage; air pollution perception; environmental knowledge; risk amplification,,SOCIAL AMPLIFICATION; RISK; MEDIA; PERCEPTIONS; ATTITUDES; URBAN; TRUST,WOS

Air quality forecasting (AQF) can inform early public health warnings aimed at mitigating exposure to air pollution and promoting behaviours that may be less impactful on air quality (e.g. transport, home heating). Although research in this area is limited, evidence suggests that it is important to understand the factors influencing people's attitudes towards air quality and the perceived benefits of AQF-based warnings to inform policy on the most optimal ways to engage the public on this matter. As part of the implementation of a local clean air strategy embedding AQF, and guided by information processing theories, this study investigated perceptions of the potential introduction of AQF-based warnings among 509 adults in Cork City (Ireland) via an online survey including quantitative and qualitative questions. Content analysis identified overall positive views, with perceived benefits including education, exposure management, and, to a lesser extent, behavioural change. Quantitative analysis showed moderate levels of concern, low awareness of air quality monitoring and low sense of personal control, thus supporting the need for accessible and actionable messaging. We observed variations in attitudes and engagement preferences based on both socio-demographic and psychological factors. Policy implications are discussed with regards to the importance of positive messaging and diversified communication channels to optimise AQF-based public warnings",air quality forecasting; public health warnings; citizen's attitudes; evidence-based policies; information strategies,Behavioral research; Forecasting; Health risks; Public health; Public policy; Quality control; Air quality forecasting; Behavioral changes; Citizen’s attitude; Evidence-based; Evidence-based policy; Information strategy; Ireland; Perceived benefits; Public health warning; Quality risks; Air quality,PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR; INFORMATION-SEEKING; POLLUTION; PERCEPTION; MANAGEMENT; MEDIA,WOS

As a result, behavioural adjustments and pollutant filtration product implementation have become common means for people to cope with pollution threats in their daily lives. However, a systematic awareness of the basic characteristics and mechanisms of such behaviours is lacking. This paper focuses on how residents engage in inverted quarantine in response to air pollution. We examine in detail their behavioural responses by conducting a questionnaire survey. Results show that individual avoidance behaviours are quite diverse and combined. Masks have been identified as the most widely adopted filtration product with the lowest input costs. High-income groups have a higher tendency to purchase expensive filtering devices compared with low-income groups and prefer to combine multiple protection strategies. In addition to the driving effect of income, individual psychological perception plays an important role in the decision making of households. A lower public confidence in the government further encourages individual self-protection. These findings urge the government to enhance their air pollution control efforts and their timeliness of disclosing pollution information. The significant driving effects of individual cognition factors also call for a proper guidance to achieve a rational public perception of air pollution. Although the health benefits of using pollutant filtering devices have been widely discussed and proven, the increased energy consumption and other environmental impacts resulting from the use of such products are easily neglected. It demands the implementation of stricter market entrance, improved energy efficiency standards and enhanced waste management. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates the barriers facing experts, across both scientific research and air quality management, in translating and incorporating satellite data into end user activities, and identifies pathways for the use of current and future satellite data by potential end users. Through an iterative Delphi-inspired two-round study, two groups of experts were issued parallel, near-identical surveys. These groups were Group A: current users of satellite data such as satellite product developers, researchers and air quality scientists, and Group B: potential end users of satellite data such as regulatory bodies, local authorities, government departments and independent air quality consultancies. This study confirmed that satellite data has had minimal penetration into Group B activities, and that a number of barriers currently prevent its adoption into regulation, namely: personnel-related issues such as lack of resources, technical skills and training, and technical limitations such as spatio-temporal resolution, uncertainties and data storage concerns. Despite this, there was a strong desire across both groups for collaboration and joint data exploration, but current progress has been minimal. Moving forward, we propose the creation of a network of experts, facilitated by a dedicated boundary organisation, designed to promote collaboration and knowledge exchange between these two groups, with the objective of transferring satellite data sets into end user work flows and to prepare end users to utilise future data sets. © 2023 The Authors",Air quality; Collaboration; Knowledge exchange; Regulation; Satellite,United Kingdom; air quality; Delphi analysis; knowledge; monitoring system; policy making; regulatory framework; satellite data; adoption; air monitoring; air quality; article; government; human; information storage; language; skill; uncertainty; United Kingdom; workflow,,Scopus

The study employed a cross-sectional design to obtain quantitative data form 1404 respondents, and the results were analysed with SPSS version 23. There were more (54.1%) female respondents than males (45.9%) in the study. The majority (70.5%) of the respondents were aware of the haze (air pollution) and its adverse effects on health. There was however a significant relationship between the sociodemographics and air pollution awareness (P = 0.01). There was also a correlation between residents' age, educational level, length of stay, marital status, and knowledge/awareness rate of air pollution (P < 0.05). Although the majority of the respondents are aware of air pollution and its relationship to their health, rates of awareness were low in some demographic groups like the elderly and the less educated. Therefore, nondiscriminatory policies should be formed toward the education and guidance of people to become knowledgeable about air pollution and related health challenges.

In this study, we aim to determine the KAP and information demand in the context of haze and its effects on health. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Changchun, China, between October and November 2016. A purposive sample comprising four groups (college students, occupational population, traffic police, and elderly population) were investigated. Personal information and questions pertaining to KAP and information demand on haze pollution and health were collected through questionnaire. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 888 residents. The awareness rate was 57.7% and varied significantly with education, exercise, and population group (p < 0.05). Among the four groups, college students scored the lowest in attitudes and practices, whereas traffic police scored the highest. Concerning the source of information demand, the elderly and traffic police preferred traditional information access (i.e., television and newspaper), whereas college students and the occupational population preferred new social media (i.e., mobile newspaper and social media sites). Regarding the most trusted department that releases information, all residents relied on the haze information released by the environmental protection department and meteorological department.

It also assesses the impact of frames that accentuate the costs and benefits of the nation's coal usage on individuals' support for coal-based energy development. It draws from framing theory to develop hypotheses tested in two distinct survey experiments that recruited a representative sample of residents living in the Seoul Metropolitan area. We find that frames that highlight the need for immediate policy action, by blaming China, Korea or both nations, decreases satisfaction with existing national efforts. Moreover, frames that attribute blame exclusively to China decrease satisfaction with China's efforts to combat the problem. On the domestic front, we find that Koreans' views toward increased coal use are a function of exposure to a coal-costs or coal-benefits frame; however, when the frames appear simultaneously in competition, considerations about the economic benefits overpower concerns about the negative health effects. The results emphasize how frames can shift perceptions about the need for policy action as well as in securing public support or opposition toward a specific polluting energy source.",Framing effects; Competitive frames; Korean air pollution; Public opinion; Pollution haven; Coal use,,PUBLIC-OPINION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NEWS MEDIA; ENERGY; FRAMES; CONSTRUCTION; TECHNOLOGY; SUPPORT,WOS

The results suggest that people perceive the air quality in their region to be generally unhealthy, particularly for sensitive groups. The air quality is more likely to be reported as being unhealthy by people with health problems and less unhealthy by Latinos and people who report regularly exercising. Latinos are more likely to report working outdoors regularly, but also more likely to report being able to reduce their exposure if the air quality is unhealthy.

However, people have different perceptions of the severity of air pollution, even in similarly polluted environments. Based on a quantitative analysis of Chinese General Social Survey data, air quality index data, news reports in 2013, and multi-site anthropological observations, this paper demonstrates that the public perception of air pollution is not determined by physiological feelings and the external environment, but rather by the media, social networks, and other sociocultural factors, which are highly localized.

The two environmental issues could be linked through people's general tastes for environmental amenities helping to determine residential location choice, implying that residents of heavily-polluted neighbourhoods may care less about envi-ronmental amenities in general, including greenspace. Alternatively, high pollution levels could force people to reduce their local outdoor activities and thereby devalue urban greenspace as local recreational resources. Finally, residents of severely-polluted areas may derive additional benefits from greenspace as trees can enhance air quality. To examine these issues, we undertook choice experiment surveys in Beijing to elicit willingness to pay (WTP) for three types of greenspace: a neighbourhood park near respondents' homes, a city park in central Beijing and a national park outside the city. We then used air pollution data to help explain the spatial heterogeneity in WTP. Neighbourhood parks provide direct air purification services for communities nearby, and our results indeed suggest that respondents exposed to higher pollution levels have higher WTP for a new neighbourhood park. However, we failed to find evidence of a significant effect of pollution on WTP for a new city park or a new national park. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Individual factors, such as expectations and perceived environment history, may influence the acceptability response. Longitudinal studies with multi-day design are absent in the literature. Fifteen Singaporean subjects participated in a 7-day longitudinal experiment in which they carried a portable sensor that continuously recorded personal air temperature, relative humidity and carbon dioxide concentration at 1-min intervals. Instantaneous TA and PAQA were regularly sampled by survey for each subject. High acceptability was found at home, restaurants and workplaces, whereas low acceptability was found for outdoor and transport environments. The participants, from Singapore's modern tropical environment spent an average of 96% of their time indoors. Weak associations were reported between acceptabilities and measured physical parameters taken independently. Clustering data by location, subject's sleeping ventilation habit, air-conditioning operation status and the changes in physical parameters over a designated time period enhanced the understanding of the acceptability results. In general, acceptability was lower for those who slept in air-conditioned environments than for those who slept without air-conditioning. The carbon dioxide mixing ratio was critical for PAQA predictions but not for TA. The Gaussian process (GP) had a better predictive power than a multiple linear regression approach. Using GP, we found that a general predictive model had comparable simulation performance as for individual predictive models. The longitudinal experiment has demonstrated effectiveness for TA and PAQA analysis, which could be beneficial to future studies in personal comfort prediction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Environmental exposure history; Perceived air quality acceptability (PAQA); Personal acceptabilities simulation; Portable sensor; Thermal acceptability (TA),Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Air conditioning; Air quality; Linear regression; Environmental exposure; Perceived air quality; Personal acceptabilities simulation; Portable sensors; Thermal acceptabilities; air quality; carbon dioxide; computer simulation; relative humidity; sensor; temperature effect; Carbon dioxide,,Scopus

Urban areas have a huge potential for human exposure to the severity of air pollution and health concerns. Therefore, it is essential to advance our understanding of the factors influencing behaviour to provide compelling evidence for successful behavioural interventions and guidelines. Doing so will increase the practicality of public adaptation to the guidelines. Yet, little is known about the adaptive behaviour toward air pollution. This study aims to establish a predictive model of factors impacting the adaptative behaviour of urban Malaysians toward air quality. A deductive theory-generating research approach and a correlational research design were used in the development of a new ABR model.

In this paper, misperception is defined as the difference between subjective perceptions of air pollution and measurements through objective monitoring. We find that pessimistic respondents are more likely to participate in pro-environmental behaviors. The media use and evaluation of the environmental performance of the local government significantly stimulate pro-environmental participation. The results reveal that knowledge and concern about the environment can mitigate the negative effect of optimistic bias on pro-environmental behaviors. In regions where environmental information is widely available, environmental pessimists are especially more likely to participate in such activities. This finding suggests that the government should provide not only accurate information about environmental pollution but also relevant education to enhance the environmental awareness of the public and stimulate pro-environmental participation. © 2022 The Authors",Air pollution; Misperception; Optimism bias; Pessimism bias; Pro-environmental behaviors,,,Scopus

Objective: Our aim was to compare associations between modeled exposures, the perceived level of these exposures and reported symptoms (non-specific symptoms, sleep disturbances, and respiratory symptoms) for three different environmental exposures (radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF), noise, and air pollution). These environmental exposures vary in the degree to which they can be sensorially observed. Methods: Participant characteristics, perceived exposures, and self-reported healthwere assessedwith a baseline (n = 14,829, 2011/2012) and follow-up (n = 7905, 2015) questionnaire in the Dutch population-based Occupational and Environmental Health Cohort (AMIGO). Environmental exposures were estimated at the home address using spatial models. Cross-sectional and longitudinal regression models were used to examine the associations between modeled and perceived exposures, and reported symptoms. Results: The extent towhich exposure sources could be observed by participants likely influenced correlations between modeled and perceived exposure as correlations were moderate for air pollution (rSp= 0.34) and noise (rSp = 0.40), but less so for RF-EMF (rSp = 0.11). Perceived exposures were consistently associated with increased symptom scores (respiratory, sleep, non-specific). Modeled exposures, except RF-EMF, were associated with increased symptom scores, but these associations disappeared or strongly diminished when accounted for perceived exposure in the analyses. Discussion: Perceived exposure has an important role in symptomreporting. When environmental determinants of symptoms are studied without acknowledging the potential role of both modeled and perceived exposures, there is a risk of bias in health risk assessment. However, the etiological role of exposure perceptions in relation to symptom reporting requires further research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Many studies have shown that electrifying the taxi fleet is effective in reducing roadside pollution and carbon footprint. However, high ownership cost of electric taxis, limited driving range, and availability of chargers are constraining their deployment. Government subsidy has been sought for in many applications, yet the required amount can be enormous and remains infeasible in many jurisdictions. To address these issues, electric taxis are proposed to provide premium services and let all stakeholders share the financial input. That is, a higher fare will be charged to the taxi customers for a higher service quality. The taxi drivers with higher incomes will be able to pay more to rent the electric taxis. With an increase of rental income to the taxi owners, fewer financial incentives from the government will be required. This study aims to uncover the factors underpinning how taxi owners and drivers choose between conventional taxis and the proposed premium electric taxis. Stated-preference surveys were conducted in Hong Kong, and two separate binary logistic regression models were calibrated accordingly. It was found that the (subsidized) vehicle purchase price, rental income, and battery lifespan were influential to the owners, while fare income, the rental cost, the access time to chargers, and the range per charge significantly affected taxi drivers' decisions. An equilibrium model with an iterative solution procedure is proposed to illustrate the interactions between the stakeholders and predict the changes in percentage-of-switch under different policy settings. Policy implications to improve taxi service and reduce roadside emissions and pollution are hence discussed.",Roadside emission reduction; Electric vehicles; Premium taxi service; Stated-preference survey; Sustainable transportation,Behavioral research; Carbon footprint; Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Logistic regression; Public policy; Quality of service; Roadsides; Taxicabs; Traffic surveys; Binary logistic regression models; Emission reduction; Emissions and pollution; Equilibrium modeling; Financial incentives; Stated preference surveys; Sustainable transportation; Taxi services; atmospheric pollution; electric vehicle; emission control; modeling; sustainable development; taxi transport; traffic emission; Fleet operations,RANGE ANXIETY; EMISSIONS; VEHICLES,WOS

Urban resident's PM2.5 reduction behavior contributes significantly to Chinese haze pollution control. Resident-level policy measures are beneficial for encouraging residents to engage in PM2.5 reduction behaviors. The current research aims to explore the long-term intervention effects of three types of policies (i.e., command and control policies, economic incentive policies and education-guided policies) on resident's PM2.5 reduction intention and actual behavior. Based on the agent-based modeling and simulation approach, a resident's PM2.5 reduction behavioral simulation model is developed, and data adopted from a questionnaire survey are analyzed. The simulation results show that resident's PM2.5 reduction intention is motivated by the interactions among resident agents, and it eventually stabilizes at a higher level (from 4.11 to 4.48). Moreover, the effects of the three types of policy measures on PM2.5 reduction behavior vary depending on the specific scenarios. With respect to single-policy scenarios, these policies all enhance the actual resident's PM2.5 reduction behavior over the long term. The effects of command and control policies (M = 3.42) and education-guided policies (M = 3.44) are much better than those of the economic incentive policies (M = 3.15). Regarding policy combination scenarios, a combination of economic incentive policies and education-guided policies (M-II = 4.15) has a remarkable promotional effect over others for encouraging residents to conduct PM2.5 reduction behaviors. Based on the results, implications and suggestions for improving current resident-level PM2.5 reduction policies and encouraging resident's PM2.5 reduction behavior are provided.",PM2; 5 reduction behavior; Policy measures; Command and control policies; Economic incentive policies; Education-guided policies; Agent-based simulation,,PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR; ENERGY-SAVING BEHAVIOR; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; EXTENDED THEORY; CONSUMERS INTENTION; PSYCHOLOGICAL-FACTORS; REDUCING PM2.5; CHINESE CITIES; CO2 EMISSIONS; POLLUTION,WOS

This study was undertaken to investigate the link between air pollution and health impacts for Mumbai, and estimate the monetary burden of these impacts. Study design: Cross-sectional data were subjected to logistic regression to analyse the link between air pollution and health impacts, and the cost of illness approach was used to measure the monetary burden of these impacts. Methods: Data collected by the Environmental Pollution Research Centre at King Edward Memorial Hospital in Mumbai were analysed using logistic regression to investigate the link between air pollution and morbidity impacts. The monetary burden of morbidity was estimated through the cost of illness approach. For this purpose, information on treatment costs and foregone earnings due to illness was obtained through the household survey and interviews with medical practitioners. Results: Particulate matter (PM(10)) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) emerged as the critical pollutants for a range of health impacts, including symptoms such as cough, breathlessness, wheezing and cold, and illnesses such as allergic rhinitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study developed the concentration-response coefficients for these health impacts. The total monetary burden of these impacts, including personal burden, government expenditure and societal cost, is estimated at 4522.96 million Indian Rupees (INR) or US$ 113.08 million for a 50-mu g/m(3) increase in PM(10), and INR 8723.59 million or US$ 218.10 million for a similar increase in NO(2). Conclusions: The estimated monetary burden of health impacts associated with air pollution in Mumbai mainly comprises out-of-pocket expenses of city residents. These expenses form a sizable proportion of the annual income of individuals, particularly those belonging to poor households. These findings have implications for public health policy, particularly accessibility and affordability of health care for poor households in Mumbai. The study provides a rationale for strengthening the public health services in the city to make them more accessible to poor households, especially those living in the slums of Mumbai.

We developed wearable sensors to record particulate matter (PM), and through a community science approach, students of partnering Chicago high schools monitored PM concentrations during their commutes over a five- and thirteen-day period. Our main objective was to investigate how mobile monitoring influenced students' environmental attitudes and we did this by having the students explore the relationship between PM concentrations and urban vegetation. Urban vegetation was approximated with a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using Landsat 8 satellite imagery. While the linear regression for one partner school indicated a negative correlation between PM and vegetation, the other indicated a positive correlation, contrary to our expectations. Survey responses were scored on the basis of their environmental affinity and knowledge. There were no significant differences between cumulative pre- and post-experiment survey responses at Josephinum Academy, and only one weakly significant difference in survey results at DePaul Prep in the Knowledge category. However, changes within certain attitudinal subscales may possibly suggest that students were inclined to practice more sustainable behaviors, but perhaps lacked the resources to do so.",air quality; wearable sensors; particulate matter; environmental attitudes; community science,,AIR-POLLUTION; QUALITY; JUSTICE,WOS

Few studies have examined neighborhood perceptions as important and modifiable non-chemical stressors of the built environment that may exacerbate effects of air pollution on cardiopulmonary health outcomes, particularly among general population based cohorts. This study examined associations between low-level chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and cardiopulmonary health, and the potential mediating or modifying effects of adverse neighborhood perceptions. Using data from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW), 2230 non-asthmatic adults age 21-74 were included in the analyses. The overall goals of this study were to assess if individuals who experience stress from neighborhood environments in which they live were more sensitive to low levels of fine particular matter (PM2.5 g/m(3)). Demographic predictors of air pollution exposure included younger age, non-White race, lower education and middle class income. After adjustments, objective lung function measures (FEV1 and FEV1 to FVC ratio) were the only cardiopulmonary health indicators significantly associated with chronic three-year annual averages of PM2.5. Among all non-asthmatics, a ten unit increase in estimated three year annual average PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with lower forced expiratory volume (L) in one second FEV1 ( = -0.40 g/L; 95% CI -0.45, -0.06). Among all individuals, adverse perceptions of the neighborhood built environment did not appear to statistically moderate or mediate associations. However, stratified analysis did reveal significant associations between PM2.5 and lung function (FEV1) only among individuals with negative perceptions and increased reports of neighborhood stressors. These findings included individuals who felt their neighborhoods were poorly maintained ( = -0.82; 95% CI -1.35, -0.28), experienced stress from crime ( = -0.45; 95% CI -0.94, 0.04) or reported neighborhood is not well maintained ( = -1.13, CI -2.04, -0.24). These significant associations were similar for FEV1 to FVC ratio. Multi-pronged approaches addressing both neighborhood built environment aesthetics and air pollution regulation may be necessary to protect vulnerable and susceptible individuals and reduce persistent inequalities.",neighborhood perceptions; fine particulate matter (PM2.5); cardiopulmonary health; lung function; stress; disparities; built environment; social determinants,,AIR-POLLUTION EXPOSURES; LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; LUNG-FUNCTION; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; ENVIRONMENTAL INEQUALITY; RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION; RISK-ASSESSMENT; BLOOD-PRESSURE; MENTAL-HEALTH; GREEN SPACE,WOS

Whilst there is an expanding literature documenting this disproportionate distribution, most previous studies have taken place in the Global North, have focused with industrial or vehicle air pollution sources and have tend to ignore the complex interactions between exposures, public perceptions and social factors. In this paper, we investigate the social vulnerability to and risk perceptions of air pollution sourced from domestic heating in two Chilean cities with particularly high levels of PM2.5 during winter months. To this end, we integrate primary survey data, with geographically detailed estimates of air pollution exposures and area-level characteristics obtained from the Chilean Census. We first examine the spatial distribution of PM2.5 exposures and air quality perceptions, and subsequently explore relationships between socio-demographic characteristics, air pollution exposure, and health concerns. Our results revel evident spatial patterns of dispersion, with some neighborhoods being more polluted than others. Age and percentage of roofs in poor condition in the participant's census tract are the best predictors of PM2.5 exposure. We find no correlation between perceived and real levels of contamination. Our multivariate analysis indicates that personal perceptions of air quality are significantly associated with age, gender, family structure, and heating behaviors. Such detailed depictions provide insights into potential meaningful strategies to improve air quality and highlight the need to incorporate measures to better protect older adults.",Public perception; Air pollution; Chile; Environmental justice; PM2 5,Chile; air quality; atmospheric pollution; census; environmental justice; heating; particulate matter; perception; pollution exposure; vulnerability,ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ANALYSIS; POLLUTION EXPOSURE; PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; RISK PERCEPTION; HEALTH-RISKS; URBAN; COMMUNITY; BURDEN; EXPERIENCE; SYMPTOMS,WOS

Previous studies did not involve this indicator, so we need to re-examine and compare the effects of objective air quality data and subjective perception on Life satisfaction (LS). The data were collected from Xi'an, a megacity of Northwest China. Particles smaller than 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and Air quality index (AQI) acquired from air quality stations were used to calculate pollutant concentrations near the vicinity of subjects' home by Geographical information system (GIS) software. In this paper, the ordinal logistic regression models are used to explain ratings of LS in terms of the objective air pollution data, social and economic variables. The results indicate that the objective air pollution data has significant and negative effects on LS of the surveyed respondents. However, when the subjective perception of air pollution is considered in the regression models, it shows that the subjective perception of air pollution has a significant negative impact on LS, while the effects of PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and AQI on the LS become insignificant. Furthermore, the research significances and policy suggestions are discussed in this paper.

The secondary aim was to examine such associations varied at specific time. A total of 340 participants were recruited from the Tsinghua University, in Beijing, China. Accelerometers provided PA measures, including moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), walking steps, energy expenditure and sedentary time for 7 consecutive days. Corresponding air pollution data by the Beijing Municipal Ecological Environment Bureau in the closed site (Wan Liu site) in Tsinghua University were collected including average hourly air quality index (AQI) and PM2.5 (mu g/m(3)). Associations were estimated using linear individual fixed-effect regressions. We also conducted an air pollution risk perception survey among 2307 freshmen (76.6% males) who were enrolled in Tsinghua in 2016, and the survey was done in May 22-26, 2017.

This study investigated the students' thermal comfort and perceived air quality in natural ventilated university classrooms under such low outdoor temperature. 30 field-surveys were conducted in seven typical university classrooms during November 2017 in a sub-provincial city of Xi'an located in the north-west of China in the cold climate zone. A total of 992 responses from the university students ages between 17 and 22 years were received. The results showed that the thermal neutral temperature was 20.6 °C; the thermal comfort temperature range was from 19.5 to 21.8 °C; the occupants' preference temperature was 22.78 °C. The thermal dissatisfaction rate was lower than 10% when the indoor operative temperature ranges between 18.3 and 23.8 °C. The percentage of dissatisfied occupants for indoor air quality was higher than 20% in some cases and it was not related to CO2 concentration. Based on the survey results, it was found that the comfort temperature calculated by the aPMV model (China's thermal comfort model for free-running buildings)was higher than the experiment results. The occupant density affected the perceived air quality, but had no effect on thermal sensation. Moreover, the influence factors of perceived air quality including indoor temperature, enthalpy, thermal acceptability and thermal sensation were analyzed. Results showed that the occupants' acceptability of indoor air quality was mainly affected by thermal sensation. © 2019",High occupancy rate; Low outdoor temperature; Natural ventilated classroom; Perceived air quality; Thermal comfort,China; Apple mosaic virus; Air quality; Atmospheric temperature; Indoor air pollution; Space heating; Students; Surveys; Ventilation; Free running buildings; Natural ventilated classroom; Occupancy rate; Outdoor temperature; Outdoor-air temperature; Perceived air quality; Thermal acceptabilities; Thermal comfort models; air quality; climate; indoor air; temperature effect; ventilation; Thermal comfort,,Scopus

Indoor air questionnaires are useful for collecting information about the occupants' experiences and perceptions of the indoor air and for evaluating the results of the measures taken. A common way to implement health questionnaires is to ask the respondents to describe symptoms at certain time points, such as weeks or months. The aim of our study was to develop a short and easy online questionnaire to assess symptoms and perceived IAQ. We also aimed to test the usability of the questionnaire in school buildings and assess the differences between the online measurement data (CO2, T, and RH) and the IAQ complaints and symptoms reported by the pupils. A total of 105 teachers and 1268 pupils in 36 classrooms at six schools answered the questionnaires over a two-week period. The participants completed the questionnaire always after the lesson in the studied classroom. We received 719 answers from the teachers and 6322 answers from the pupils. The results demonstrated that the teachers reported more IAQ problems and symptoms than the pupils did. Differences between classrooms were observed in both the IAQ problem and reference schools. The most common significant differences (p-value > 0.05) between the classrooms were among humidity, too cold air, and stuffy air, and among symptoms, dry/sore throat, tiredness, headache, and skin symptoms. Maximum values of CO2 measurements and the highest prevalence of stuffy air were relatively consistent. The testing process demonstrated that such a questionnaire was suitable for adults and children aged at least 12 years. The results of our study suggest that a quick and easy online questionnaire that is completed within a short period may be useful for gathering valuable knowledge about perceived IAQ. It could be used in combination with other indoor environment investigations to produce detailed results and restorative measures.",indoor air; health questionnaire; symptoms; pupils; teachers,,RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; ELEMENTARY-SCHOOLS; HEALTH SYMPTOMS; VENTILATION RATES; MOISTURE DAMAGE; CHILDREN; ASTHMA; DAMPNESS; ASSOCIATIONS; PERFORMANCE,WOS

Methods: We analyzed data from the Porter Novelli Public Services YouthStyles survey, a nationally representative survey of U.S. adolescents aged 12-17 years. In survey years 2015-2018, a total of 3,547 adolescents self-reported awareness, perceptions, and behaviors related to air pollution. We calculated weighted percentages of respondents reporting each aspect of air quality awareness, perception, and behaviors overall and by categories of age, gender, parental education, metropolitan status, region, and survey year. Results: Overall, an estimated 81% of U.S. adolescents thought outdoor air pollution could impact health, 52% thought there were things they could do to limit their or their family's exposure, 19% were aware of air quality alerts, 46% of those who thought or were informed air quality was bad did something differently, and 19% always or usually avoided busy roads to reduce air pollution exposure; differences were reported by some demographic variables. Conclusions: Among U.S. adolescents, awareness that air pollution could impact health was relatively high. However, gaps were found in the awareness of the potential impacts and other aspects of awareness and perceptions related to air pollution and the engagement in behaviors to reduce exposure, some of which varied by demographic characteristics. These results can be used to inform interventions that increase awareness and behaviors to reduce air pollution exposures among U.S. adolescents.

We explored the association between maternal exposure to outdoor air pollution during different trimesters of pregnancy and the prevalence of behavioral difficulties among 657 preschool children aged 3-4 from three kindergartens in Wuhan, China. This is a cross-sectional study. Children's behavioral difficulties were assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (reported by parents). Maternal exposure to outdoor air pollutants during pregnancy were estimated based on the daily average measured concentration levels from ground monitoring stations. Potential confounding factors including children-related, maternal, and socio-economic status (SES) were adjusted in the study. We calculated the prevalence of each type of behavioral difficulties and used binary logistic regression method to estimate the crude odds ratio (cOR), adjusted odds ratio (aOR), and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for 1g/m(3) increase in each air pollutant during every exposure window in single- and two-pollutant models. The prevalence of participants' total behavioral difficulties was 9.6%.

The low-idle emissions data from these surveys show that 10 percent of the fleet are responsible for about 60 percent of the exhaust hydrocarbons and also that 10 percent of the fleet (not necessarily the same vehicles) are responsible for about 60 percent of the carbon monoxide emissions. We also show that high emitters appear among all model years, and not just among old vehicles, as previously assumed. Old vehicles, on average, have higher idle emissions than new vehicles, but they contribute relatively little to the total idle emissions because there are so few on the road. We compare roadside survey results at I/M and non-I/M locations in California, and observe identical tampering and overall failure rates at the two types of locations. We also show that motorists are taking steps to ''pass the test,'' and that the high-emitting vehicles' idle-emissions performance and tampering rates in the roadside surveys are unaffected by the Smog Check test. These results imply that success in California's Smog Check program in reducing emissions will require consideration of human behavior and the attendant negative incentives inherent in the program as historically conceived. EPA's national tampering surveys also show little difference in tampering rates among areas with decentralized, centralized and no I/M programs.

However, the policy costs have never been well evaluated from the perspective of the residents. We conducted a survey of 633 Beijing residents with a choice experimental setting, and evaluate the current air pollution control policies. The main findings include: (1) Restriction of private vehicle driving does increase utility of residents; (2) Replacing coal-dominated heating system with natural gas has a better effect on air pollution control than replacement with electricity; (3) Beijing residents demand more radical policies to control air pollution and, according to our estimation, are willing to pay 5.1% of their income for more such policy measures; (4) The capital city function of Beijing yields many economic and political advantages for the residents, and the economic benefit is equal to 8.3% of their income.",Beijing city; air pollution; choice experiment; status quo; policy choices,,WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; CONTINGENT VALUATION; ASSOCIATION; EXPOSURE; QUALITY; PM2.5,WOS

Results show that participants who applied to the programme are, on average, older than non-applicants, are more likely to have a respiratory impairment, tend to evaluate indoor air quality worse than non-applicants and tend to perceive the health effects of air pollution as more severe. The findings also suggest that motivation to improve air quality is a key aspect for understanding the adoption of pellet stoves when the requirement for initial investment is removed.

However, not everyone bears the burden of exposure to air pollution equally, and outdoor workers are particularly exposed. In this study, we sought to better understand how local residents and outdoor workers in central Bangkok experience air pollution in their day-to-day life, through a survey of their symptoms and mitigation measures. Respondents were aware of the risks of air pollution but felt there was little they could do about their exposure to it. We also asked a subset of respondents to carry a portable PM2.5 sensor during their working day, to assess which occupations and locations faced highest pollution exposure. We found that all workers, including those who didn’t always work outdoors, faced exposure that exceeded both the WHO and Thailand 24-hour PM2.5 standards, at 43.94 μg/m3 on average. These findings demonstrate that workers face harmful levels of daily exposure and should be provided with appropriate mitigating measures by their employers to limit their exposure, and targeted health screenings.

Design/methodology/approach Data were obtained from restaurant managers operating their business in South Korea, considered to be qualified to provide accurate information regarding the survey questions. A scenario-based experimental approach was used to test the hypothesized relationships. Cognitive and emotional risk judgements were assessed for its potential interaction effects on the relationships between restaurant perceptions of PM source attributions, preventions attitudes and mitigation behavioral intentions. Findings Results revealed that perceptions of PM main sources were attributed to internal rather than external factors, which improved mitigation behavioral intentions. Such an effect was partially mediated through PM pollution prevention attitudes. Additionally, when applying external source attributions, PM mitigation behavioral intentions were improved by cognitive risk judgements, and PM prevention attitudes were enhanced by affective risk judgements. Research limitations/implications Results assist restaurants to better understand their operations that may be emitting significant levels of PM, thereby encouraging them to set more ambitious and effective PM mitigation operational guidelines for their employees and diners.

This study examines the effect of pedestrianization on individuals' air quality perception and satisfaction, based on three regenerated streets in Seoul, Korea. We analyzed data from 672 questionnaires administered after the pedestrianization project. We used a subset of variables in a binary logistic regression model to understand general determinants of user satisfaction toward their walking environment. Our case study contributes to the verification of pedestrianization effects on air quality perceptions. Results show that overall satisfaction could be acquired through positive perceptions of air quality, as achieved through pedestrianization of streets. Moreover, pedestrian satisfaction varies according to the purpose, activities and health-related behaviors and attitudes.

Nevertheless, health promotion emphasizing the impact of air pollution is not popular, even among health professionals. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the perceptions of paediatricians regarding its impact on children’s health in Indonesia. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional design using an online questionnaire was employed in this study. It was composed of 30 items and divided into 4 sections, i.e. section 1 explored the demographic variables, section 2 measured the respondent’s information-seeking behavior on the issue of air pollution, section 3 measured the perception of issues related to air pollution and its impact on children’s health, and section 4 explored the respondent’s experience in practicing environmental health education with respect to their patients. Only completed surveys were analysed. Results: Of the 171 pediatricians who were accessed for the survey, 120 (70.2%) completed it. The majority of respondents (69%) resided in Java island and worked in urban areas (84%). About 41.7% of the respondents had little to no information on the impact of air pollution on children’s health. More than 80% of the respondents received information from scientific articles, followed by seminars (61.5%), the internet (53.8%), colleagues (30.7%), and workshops/training (17.3%). Nearly one-third of the respondents considered air quality as poor in their working environment. Almost all agreed that air pollution can affect children’s health and increase the risk of respiratory allergies and even the risk of skin allergies for children under two years of age. In daily practice, most respondents (53.3%) admitted that they never or rarely treated patients with diseases related to air pollution. About one-third of the respondents (36.7%) had never or rarely asked their patients about their living environment. Conclusion: Pediatricians are aware of the impact of air pollution on the risk of respiratory allergies and infection, and therefore often provide environmental health education to patients. This study has reported that the majority of pediatricians in Indonesia have an understanding of the impact of air pollution on children’s health; however, there is still a lack of health promotion to be communicated to the patients and their families in their daily practice. © 2023 The Author(s).

Urban air quality remains a major concern for both public health officials and the general public. In the United States, air quality public awareness campaigns are major efforts of governments at every level. Yet, our understanding of relationships between ambient air pollution exposure, public perceptions of air quality, and concerns about associated health risks is incomplete. We examined 2869 individual responses to annual air quality public awareness surveys administered between 2009 and 2012 in the Kansas City metropolitan area. Our study had three objectives: 1) examine the spatial distribution of PM2.5 and O-3 exposures, pollution perceptions, and pollution health concerns; 2) explore relationships between individual- and area-level characteristics and PM2.5 and O-3 exposure; 3) and examine cross-sectional associations between individual- and area-level characteristics, as well as PM2.5 and O-3 exposures, and pollution perception and pollution health concerns. We found inverse spatial patterns between the distribution of O-3 and PM2.5 exposure levels as well as between areas where respondents perceived air pollution as worsening and areas where residents had higher concern about the health effects of pollution exposure. We also found inverse relationships between individual- and area-level demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and O-3 and PM2.5 exposure. Individual-level characteristics were significantly related to pollution perceptions, while both individual- and area-level characteristics were significantly related to pollution health concerns. Public awareness campaigns should be combined with education on ways the public can protect themselves and tailored explicitly for targeting vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly, and persons with respiratory problems) and areas both socioeconomically vulnerable (e.g., higher racial segregation and poverty) and experiencing higher pollution exposure (e.g., O-3 and PM2.5).",,,TERM OZONE EXPOSURE; PARTICULATE MATTER; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS; ENVIRONMENTAL RISK; RACIAL ISOLATION; BIRTH-WEIGHT; RACE; MORTALITY; GENDER,WOS

Data were available on self-rated health, neighbourhood noise, air quality, access to recreational/green areas, and other sociodemographic and neighbourhood covariates. The substantive analyses were based on weighted logistic regression with clustered standard errors. Overall, reporting major neighbourhood problems with noise and air quality was associated with higher risk for poor self-rated health, and this risk was higher among participants not using recreational/green areas in their neighbourhood or reporting a difficult access to those areas. There was a statistically significant effect modification across some exposure access scenarios, but it was clearer for air quality than it was for noise. Thus, this exploratory study sets the basis for future research on the subject matter. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Addressing IAQ not only means ensuring that contaminants are below harmful concentration but also that people exposed are satisfied. However, current standards often lack clear metrics and thresholds dedicated to Perceived Air Quality (PAQ). Therefore, it is important to examine whether there is a prevalent method in the literature that could lead towards standardization. This review study constitutes the first comprehensive critical exploration of the subject. Adopting the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, the objective is to synthesize and compare diverse methods (subjective vs instrumental evaluations; object of judgment; component of perception; rating scales) for assessing PAQ in office buildings, based on insights from 93 field and laboratory studies. Results show that the assessment of PAQ predominantly relies on questionnaires (90 %), with a very smaller percentage using alternative methods such as olfactory indices, diaries, interviews, sensory testing, and text mining techniques. Workers’ satisfaction is the most commonly evaluated aspect in PAQ questionnaires, often measured on a 7-point Likert scale. Odours are typically characterized in terms of intensity by utilizing a continuous 6-point unidirectional scale. Olfactory stimuli are usually considered with a negative connotation, being the absence of odour the target of IAQ design. The present study proposes a future research agenda that introduces the importance of a perceptual approach to evaluate the indoor olfactory environments (or smellscapes), aiming to create working spaces that are not only odour-neutral but also olfactorily pleasant. © 2024 The Authors",Indoor environmental quality; Odour; Office buildings; Perceived air quality; Smellscape,Air quality; Indoor air pollution; Odors; 'current; Air quality assessment; Diverse methods; Indoor air quality; Indoor environmental quality; Meta-analysis; Perceived air quality; Smellscape; Systematic Review; Well being; air quality; building; environmental assessment; environmental quality; indoor air; literature review; odor; Office buildings,,Scopus

This study focuses on air quality perception in relation to particulate matter in order to find potential patterns. Field questionnaire-based surveys were conducted among pedestrians on two central sites in the city of Athens, Greece, during the winter period while particulate matter of 10m or less in diameter (PM10) were concurrently measured on-site at 1-min resolution. The participants were asked to evaluate the dust and the overall pollution-related air quality based on 5-point bipolar scales. Air quality perception patterns were explored considering PM10 concentration, meteorological and thermal conditions, and subjective variables including gender, age, smoking status, and health status. An effect of PM10 on dust perception was identified, suggesting that dusty air quality conditions are reported more frequently when particulate concentration increases. Health status, exposure time, smoking status, and gender were found to affect air quality perception. Participants experiencing health symptoms, exposed to outdoor conditions for more than 30min, smokers, and females were more likely to report unfavorable air quality conditions. The comparison with the results of a previous study obtained using air pollution station data confirmed the dependence of air quality perception on participants' characteristics and particularly on their health status. Ordinal logistic regression models showed that for pedestrians who were neither smokers nor experiencing health symptoms and were exposed to outdoor conditions for more than 30min, a PM10 concentration around 64g m( -3) could be a threshold, to perceive dusty air quality conditions.",PM10; Air pollution; Perception; Field survey; Questionnaire,,PM10 MASS CONCENTRATIONS; TEMPORAL VARIATION; THERMAL SENSATION; RISK PERCEPTION; HEALTH; PEDESTRIANS; SYMPTOMS; ATHENS; TEMPERATURE; ENVIRONMENT,WOS

To reduce these emissions, we developed an automated indoor air quality (IAQ) control intervention that operated based on real-time sensor readings of particulate matter (PM2.5) and evaluated the perceptual differences between this intervention and a baseline condition. We employed a 14-participant crossover study design in a one-bedroom apartment module. Participants experienced one of two conditions: (1) Advanced Control–automated IAQ interventions including a stove hood, two portable air cleaners, and a bathroom exhaust powered on/off based on predefined PM2.5 thresholds measured by environmental sensors; and (2) Standard Control–participants controlling IAQ interventions (e.g., stove hood) manually. Each condition lasted two weeks. Participants followed standardized cooking and cleaning protocols and filled out surveys assessing psychosocial and perceptual outcomes. Observations indicated that weekly IAQ satisfaction, perception, and preferences were similar between the two conditions—despite lower PM2.5 concentrations during cooking and cleaning for the Advanced Control versus Standard Control Condition. When pairing IAQ complaints with PM2.5 concentrations during cooking, we observed participants made complaints when PM2.5 concentrations >∼80 μg/m3 but few complaints when <∼60 μg/m3. Lower PM2.5 concentrations were observed for the Advanced Control versus Standard Control Condition during cleaning, but these lower concentrations did not appear perceivable by participants due to far lower PM2.5 concentrations during cleaning overall. Our observations suggest a connection between PM2.5 concentration and IAQ complaints made by participants, thereby providing possible thresholds for perceivable IAQ changes. © 2023",Home automation; Indoor air quality; Occupant satisfaction; Perceived air quality,Air cleaners; Automation; Indoor air pollution; Quality control; Advanced control; Air quality control; Condition; Home automation; Indoor air quality; Indoor air quality monitoring; Occupant satisfaction; Perceived air quality; PM 2.5; Quality control system; air quality; concentration (composition); control system; environmental monitoring; indoor air; particulate matter; Air quality,,Scopus

Following this theory, four indicators were developed to measure people's behavioural intentions for improving air quality; two of these indicators were correlated with contingent valuation survey. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to estimate our Perception-based Behavioural Intention Model (PBIM) by using a cross-sectional data set of 759 residents of the Jinchuan mining area in Gansu Province, China. We found that Jinchuan residents' WTP for improving local air quality was significantly influenced by the perceived health risk of hazardous pollutants, environmental knowledge, socioeconomic status, current health condition, gender, work environment, and proximity to the pollution source.

We aim to clarify the extent to which perceived risks from road-traffic and wood-smoke can be explained by the individual psychological, social status-related and socio-institutional factors in the case of two Northern European countries, Finland and Estonia. This approach elucidates which of the closely intertwined factors shape the perception of risks from air pollution in different socio-institutional contexts and for different air pollution sources. The study uses data from cross-sectional population surveys conducted among 1112 Finnish and 1000 Estonian residents about environmental health risk perception and coping. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that in both countries' cases, the perceived personal and general risk from traffic exhaust and wood-smoke can be explained by the perception of exposure to pollution and, also, by the level of knowledge of, the worry about and the possible symptoms from environmental health factors. The perceived vulnerability due to poor health further sensitises individuals towards risks from air pollution. Higher trust towards state institutions in guaranteeing a healthy living environment and greater perceived openness about the risks may attenuate the feelings of vulnerability to air pollution risks in Finland compared to Estonia. The ingrained appeal for wood burning may explain the higher acceptance of exhausts from wood-burning compared to traffic.

Surveys were conducted with SJV residents (n = 198) to understand attitudes, perceptions of air quality, and behaviors related to air pollution of individuals who work outdoors. The results suggest that people who worry more about air quality tend to check air quality more often. It was found that individuals who suffer from asthma are more likely to check air quality when working and exercising outdoors. In addition, the differences on how people utilize informational sources regarding air quality were observed. Conclusion: Therefore, there is a need to further study attitudes and perceptions about air quality among populations who work outdoors.",Air quality perception; Air quality attitude; Awareness; Asthma; San joaquin valley,,PESTICIDE SAFETY; FARMWORKERS; POLLUTION; ASTHMA; RISK,WOS

Several authors have considered these relationships within a phenomenological framework. As a preliminary consideration, we have attempted in this study to isolate geographical sectors with variable exposure to air pollution. We have taken readings from seven stations for the period of January 1977 to December 1980; with the help of the difference of means test, we have singled out the significant variants. Based on these findings, we have used the gravity model to determine the strong, average, and weak sectors of exposure to total dust concentration in the air. During the summer of 1980, we submitted a stratified sampling embracing 229 persons, compiled by a telephone questionnaire, with a view to assessing to what extent the population was concerned by pollution in the surrounding air, evaluating public opinion on alternate solutions to resolve this problem, and generally investigating whether the public conscience was sufficiently crystallized to embark upon local environmental protection measures. The Quebec mining town of Thetford Mines, an important centre for asbestos extraction, was used for this investigation. The findings indicate that the population has a generally well-perceived notion of pollution even if water pollution was stressed more than air pollution. However, the perception of air pollution is dependent on distance from the mine and consequently, on exposure sectors to total dust concentration in the air. We assembled, into three groups, some 14 alternate means to attack pollution. The most exposed sector favoured indirect actions, while in other sectors direct measures were accented. Socioeconomic standing and especially education level help explain perceived differences between types of pollution, whereas sex and age are statistically significant for the choice of alternate means. Length of residence has very little influence. Generally, it does not seem that the respondents' opinion are clearly and coherently crystallized. This is understandable if we accept that the respondents appear to dissociate water from air pollution. There therefore exists a lack of apparent agreement between attitudes concerning means and attitudes concerning ends. © 1984 D.

In particular, smog in urban areas has recently attracted a great deal of scientific and media attention both domestically and internationally. Our focus in this article is on public perceptions of smog in the northern city of Tangshan, which is routinely ranked as one of the urban areas with the worst air quality in the nation. In this article, we present the results of qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys with 341 urban residents. We examine how these residents perceive and weigh the importance of various aspects related to quality of life, including their experience with air pollution. Study participants considered environmental quality an issue of lower priority than many others; however, they surprisingly ranked it over economic concerns such as jobs and income. Their responses suggest that, for many urban residents, environmental problems like smog are fundamentally linked to basic quality of life concerns such as physical health and family well-being. We interpret our findings in the context of literature on the rise of China's middle class, the rise of environmental consciousness, and the role of gender in mediating perceptions of pollution and family health.

Methods: Population-representative survey data were collected by telephone from 745 adults from Queensland, Australia. Variables assessed included socio-demographics, usual work travel mode, commute perceptions, and perceived health effects associated with air pollution during the work-related commute. Results: Approximately 45% of the sample perceived air pollution negatively affected health outcomes when commuting to/from work, yet only 13% recognised air pollution as a major barrier to walking or cycling to/from work. No relationships existed between usual travel mode to/from work and perceived health risks associated with air pollution. Those higher educated or living in major cities were more likely to recognise air pollution harmed their health during their work-related commute when compared to respective referent categories (p <= 0.05). Conclusions: Recognition of health risks from air pollution during the work-related commute was high, and awareness did not differ by travel mode. For the majority, air pollution was not a primary barrier for walking or cycling to/from work. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In Chile, many cities exceed theWorld Health Organization's norms for ambient concentration of particulatematter. In this paper, we analyze the factors explaining individuals' perceptions on fuelwood as themain cause of air pollution in urban areas and their willingness to ban this fuel to counteract its negative effects. We also explore variation across these perceptions and preferences based on individuals' degree of familiarity with air pollution and the extent towhich they are affected by the regulation in place. Using data fromthe fourth environmental survey in Chile, we estimate an ordered bivariate probitmodel to account for a potential link between these perceptions and preferences. Results reveal a disconnect between perception of the problem and preferences for regulation to the extent that individuals are more likely to be affected by the regulation (i.e., fuelwood users and regulated cities). We also find that lower-income individuals are less willing to accept a fuelwood ban, and that the level of air pollutionmatters in shaping individuals' perceptions on the causes of poor air quality and preferences for regulations, although this depends on the measures used. Finally, we find evidence that pro-environmental behavior in other domains negatively affects the perception prohibiting fuelwood use. Thus, froma policy design perspective, it is essential to consider individuals' perceptions on environmental issues and preferences for regulations, because they might be linked with feasibility of implementation and compliance.

Over the past four decades it has released large amounts of volcanic gases and aerosols which form volcanic air pollution known as ‘vog’. Communities downwind of Kīlauea have been chronically or episodically exposed to this potentially harmful air pollution and have raised concerns about the hazards of vog exposure. Public health and civil protection agencies have offered a range of advice, information, and mitigation strategies for living with vog. In this mixed-methods social study, we investigate the translation of official advice into practice in Island of Hawai‘i communities and assess how risk communication could be improved by considering public input, preferences, and community relevance. Given the paucity of information on the long-term effects of chronic vog exposure, assessing the effectiveness of public health and risk communication is vital. In 2015, through questionnaire surveys (n = 143), four focus groups and several stakeholder meetings, we assessed whether, and how, residents accessed intervention advice, if it was relevant and useful, how they acted on it and how they would like to receive advice and urgent exposure warnings in the future. We also investigated local knowledge and self-developed interventions and documented the perceived risks of vog exposure, including symptoms that people attribute to vog. Most participants (83%) perceived that vog caused health symptoms such as exacerbation of asthma, itchy eyes, and blocked nose and 62% thought it was harmful to their long-term health. A third of participants had considered relocating to avoid the vog yet, despite this, most people took no action to reduce vog exposure. Participants reported that the official advice was difficult to follow given their living situation or lifestyle. Some participants viewed the agency advice as inconsistent, irrelevant, or out of date. Participants preferred to receive advice and air quality alerts via a variety of media, depending on factors such as their access to internet, cell phone, and radio reception. The study findings led to a collaboration with federal and state health, land management, educational, science, and civil protection agencies to improve and standardize health advisory messaging, to make it more relevant to Island of Hawai‘i communities and environment. New printable and web-based communication products were developed, which included local knowledge of effective protective actions/symptom reduction strategies. An interagency ‘Vog Dashboard’ was also introduced to consolidate vog knowledge, including sources of air quality data, vog forecasts, and advice on vog environmental, agricultural, and health impacts. This dashboard was recommended as a primary site for advice by international media outlets in 2018 and was heavily used during the 2018 Kīlauea and 2022 Mauna Loa eruption crises. © 2023 The Authors",Air pollution; Exposure mitigation; Hawaii; Perceptions; Risk communication; Vog; Volcano,,,Scopus

Unlike other theory of planned behavior (TPB) extension studies, we shift the focus of inquiry from examining the mediating role of TPB variables to investigating the moderating role in promoting pro-environmental behavior. Using an online survey in China, the results indicated that attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and attention to haze-related efficacy messages were positively associated with pro-environmental behavioral intention. Notably, attention to haze-related threat messages had no significant relationship with behavioral intention. Moreover, moderation analyses revealed that the interaction effects between attention to efficacy messages and attention to threat messages on behavioral intention vary among people with different attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Theoretically, this study contributes to the literature of the TPB by analyzing its moderating role in promoting behavior change. Findings from this study suggest the importance of disseminating distinctive media messages to audiences with different personality traits, which is beneficial for practitioners to tailor specific messages in environmental campaigns.",theory of planned behavior; pro-environmental behavior; efficacy messages; threat messages,,PARALLEL PROCESS MODEL; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; FEAR APPEALS; COGNITIVE THEORY; SELF-EFFICACY; SOCIAL NORMS; COMMUNICATION; METAANALYSIS; ATTITUDE; DETERMINANTS,WOS

A respiratory illness symptom can be an indicator of health performance that is related to the personal exposure concern and the IEQ. However, little is known about the effect of personal exposure to either indoor or outdoor sources on the human perception of the IEQ. Here, we conducted a study to evaluate the association of human perception and health performance to exposure assessments by analyzing questionnaire survey obtained from 396 students and 64 parents. To test exposure conditions at different scenarios, schools and homes located in rural and urban areas were selected. We assessed the IEQ by measuring temperature, relative humidity, particulate matters, and CO2 level. Also, the effect of potential pollutant factors on the IEQ was evaluated at three different cases: vacuum cleaning, cooking, and air purifier operation. From the IEQ measurement, there was no difference in PM10 and airborne bacteria concentrations between urban and rural areas of both schools and homes. But, PM2.5 showed significant difference between the areas. CO2 levels in schools were correlated to the number of students. This study shows that health performance was strongly associated with people's perception of outdoor environmental quality. We found that perception can be considered a predictor of health performance as a health-related environmental marker. This study suggests the importance of reviewing public regulations regarding control of potential indoor pollutant sources, use of air purifiers and aspects indicative of satisfaction with indoor environmental exposure. © 2019",Health performance; Human perception; Indoor environmental quality; PM concentration; Potential source; Thermal comfort,Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Environmental regulations; Exposure controls; Health; Rural areas; Surveys; Thermal comfort; Environmental exposure; Environmental quality; Human perception; Indoor and outdoor airs; Indoor environmental quality; Measuring temperature; Pm concentrations; Potential sources; aerosol; concentration (composition); environmental quality; health impact; health risk; indoor air; point source; questionnaire survey; relative humidity; rural area; temperature effect; urban area; Air cleaners,,Scopus

The Program 4 of the Healthy Aging in Industrial Environment study investigates whether the health and wellbeing benefits of physical activity (PA) can be fully realized in individuals living in highly polluted environments. Herein, we introduce the behavioral, psychological and neuroimaging protocol of the study.MethodsThis is a prospective cohort study of N=1500 individuals aged 18-65years comparing: (1) individuals living in the highly polluted, industrial region surrounding the city of Ostrava (n=750), and (2) controls from the comparison region with relative low pollution levels in Southern Bohemia (n=750). Quota sampling is used to obtain samples balanced on age, gender, PA status (60% active runners vs. 40% insufficiently active). Participants are screened and complete baseline assessments through online questionnaires and in-person lab-based assessments of physiological, biomechanical, neuroimaging and cognitive function parameters. Prospective 12-month intensive monitoring of air pollution and behavioral parameters (PA, inactivity, and sleep) follows, with a focus on PA-related injuries and psychological factors through fitness trackers, smartphones, and mobile apps. Subsequently, there will be a 5-year follow-up of the study cohort.DiscussionThe design of the study will allow for (1) the assessment of both short-term variation and long-term change in behavioral parameters, (2) evaluation of the incidence of musculoskeletal injuries and psychological factors impacting behavior and injury recovery, and (3) the impact that air pollution status (and change) has on behavior, psychological resilience, and injury recovery. Furthermore, the integration of MRI techniques and cognitive assessment in combination with data on behavioral, biological and environmental variables will provide an opportunity to examine brain structure and cognitive function in relation to health behavior and air pollution, as well as other factors affecting resilience against and vulnerability to adverse changes in brain structure and cognitive aging. This study will help inform individuals about personal risk factors and decision-makers about the impact of environmental factors on negative health outcomes and potential underlying biological, behavioral and psychological mechanisms.

Mortality and respiratory diseases caused by air pollution are believed to be endemic in cities of these countries. Regulations and standards are the first requirement for reducing emissions from both fixed and mobile sources. In order to reduce vehicle emissions, governments of the four countries are making efforts to introduce vehicle emission regulations for new vehicles. This paper attempts to estimate the 2015 car stock by emission regulation levels from past trends. Considering these car stock results, this paper emphasizes monitoring problems such as vehicle registration systems, inspection and maintenance (I/M) systems and fuel quality monitoring systems for vehicles in use. Monitoring problems in developing countries share similar characteristics such as a weakness in government initiatives and inadequate operation of government agencies, which results from a lack of human resources and analysis of facilities. Finally, this paper proposes a method to assure air quality improvement under the different shares of emission regulations in these four ASEAN countries and introduces an example of an evaluation method based on a policy survey to improve air quality.",Air pollution; Asia; Environment and development; Regulatory policies; Transportation,,,Scopus

This study examines for the first time trends in the association between HAP from cooking fuel and under-five mortality and measures the potential impact of interventions to reduce HAP using Nepal Demographic and Health Survey datasets (2001-2011). Methods A total of 17,780 living children across four age-groups (neonatal 0-28 days, post-neonatal 1-11 months, child 12-59 months and under-five 0-59 months) were included and multi-level logistic regression models were used for analyses. Population attributable fractions of key risk factors and potential impact fractions assessing the impact of previous interventions to reduce exposure prevalence were also calculated. Results Use of cooking fuel was associated with total under-five mortality (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.37-3.51, P = 0.001) in Nepal, with stronger associations evident for sub-group analyses of neonatal mortality (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.47-4.82, P = 0.001). Higher association was found in rural areas and for households without a separate kitchen using polluting fuel for cooking, and in women who had never breastfed for all age-groups of children. PIF estimates, assuming a 63% of reduction of HAP based on previously published interventions in Nepal, suggested that a burden of 40% of neonatal and 33% of under-five mortality cases associated with an indoor kitchen using polluting fuel could be avoidable. Conclusion Improved infrastructure and behavioral interventions could help reduce the pollution from cooking fuel in the household resulting in further reduction in under-five mortality in Nepal.",Household air pollution; Cooking fuel; Under-five mortality; Attributable risk; Nepal,,SOLID-FUEL USE; BIOMASS FUEL; RISK-FACTORS; CHILDREN; INDIA; BANGLADESH; HEALTH; INFECTIONS; FRACTIONS; CHILDHOOD,WOS

Children are particularly vulnerable. While studies on the effects and toxicology of particulate matter pollutants that are 2.5 microns or smaller in size (PM2.5) are abundant, understanding the factors that influence human behaviors against or the avoidance of exposure/contact to air polluted with high levels of PM2.5 is lacking. In this study, this gap was narrowed by used the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to investigate the effects of Attitudes (AT), Subjective Norms (SN), and Perceived Behavioral Controls (PBC) on the Behavioral Intentions (BI) of parents with young children with different levels of education against or avoiding contact/exposure to air polluted with high levels of PM2.5. Methods The TPB model was used to predict the BI of parents with young children with different levels of education that live in Hong Kong using the results collected from 410 online questionnaires. Aspects of the BI influencing parents with young children that earned undergraduate group and post-graduate group were analysed using Smart Partial Least Squares 2.0 software. Results Our results revealed there were substantial differences in the AT of parents with young children that earned undergraduate and post-graduate degrees with respect to exposure to air with PM2.5 pollution. Conclusions In this study we assessed the factors that influence the air pollution prevention and avoidance behaviors of parents of the undergraduate and post-graduate groups that were exposed to air polluted with PM2.5. Our results show the AT, SN, PBC, and BI used in the air pollution protection model for the parents of both groups are connected by separate pathways.

We examined associations between prenatal exposure to traffic-related air pollution and child behavioral development milestone delays, using data from a nationwide population-based longitudinal survey in Japan, where the participants were recruited in 2001 and followed. Methods: Particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide concentrations during the 9 months before birth were obtained at the municipality level and assigned to the participants who were born in the corresponding municipality. We analyzed data from singleton births with linked pollution data available (N = 33,911 at the maximum). We used responses to survey questions about age-appropriate behaviors at ages 2.5 and 5.5 years as indicators of behavioral development. We conducted multilevel logistic regression analysis, adjusting for individual and municipality-level variables. Results: Air pollution exposure during gestation was positively associated with the risk of some developmental milestone delays at both ages. Specifically, air pollution was associated with verbal and fine motor development at age 2.5 years, and with behaviors related to inhibition and impulsivity at 5.5 years. In the fully-adjusted models, odds ratios following one-interquartile-range increase in nitrogen dioxide and suspended particulate matter were 1.24 (95% confidence interval: 1.07, 1.43) for inability to compose a two-phrase sentence at ages 2.5 and 1.10 (1.05, 1.16) for inability to express emotions at age 5.5 years, respectively. Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to traffic-related air pollution was associated with behavioral development milestone delays of children in a nationally representative sample in Japan.",,,POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; NURSES HEALTH; BIRTH-WEIGHT; AGE; NEURODEVELOPMENT; POLLUTANTS; PREGNANCY; LIFE,WOS

We are interested in the private benefits to households, because they represent additional value of the program and likely drive adoption. Combining electronic stove surface temperature and air pollution monitoring with household surveys, we estimate the effects of adoption on household fuel expenditures, indoor temperatures and indoor air pollution concentrations (PM2.5) when the stoves are in use. We also explore heterogeneous effects of the program by income group and energy poverty status. Our results suggest that, after controlling for observable characteristics of individuals and dwellings, users of pellet stoves on average enjoy 14 % lower indoor PM2.5 concentrations during hours in which stoves are in use compared with those who use traditional stoves during the same periods of time. Lower-income and energy-poor households receive much greater than average improvements in indoor air pollution than those with higher-incomes, driving the overall estimate and indicating that the program is progressive in this dimension. The improved heating stove has significantly higher operating costs, however, and we find that these costs are most salient for low-income and energy-poor households. © 2023 International Energy Initiative",Air pollution; Energy transition; Environmental policies; Heating; Household behavior; Stoves,Chile; Air quality; Environmental protection; Indoor air pollution; Operating costs; Stoves; Ambient air pollution; Energy transitions; Environmental policy; Heating stoves; Household behavior; Low incomes; Lower energies; PM 2.5; Pollution reduction; Poor households; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; cooking appliance; heating; household survey; income distribution; low income population; pollution control; pollution monitoring; pollution policy; poverty; Pelletizing,,Scopus

While plenty is known about the spatial gradients of highway emissions, very little is known about variation of lay understanding at the fine spatial scale and whether there are gradients in severity of concerns. One-hundred and four near-highway residents agreed to participate in a semi-structured interview on their knowledge and attitudes towards highway traffic emissions. Proximity to the highway edge varied within 5-380. m at the predominantly downwind side of the highway and 13-483. m at the upwind side. Likert-type ordered response questions were analysed using multivariate regression. Inverse linear relationships were identified for distance from highway and measures of concern for health impacts, as well as for noise (p<0.05). Positive linear relationships were identified for distance from highway and ratings of both outdoor and indoor air quality (p<0.05). Measures of level of income had no conclusive statistically significant effect on perceptions. Additional discussion was made surrounding participant[U+05F3]s open-ended responses, within the context of limited international research. Findings indicate that there may be quantifiable psychological benefits of separating residents just a short distance (40. m+) from highways and that living within such close proximity can be detrimental to wellbeing by restricting local outdoor activity. This work lends additional rationale for a residential separation buffer of ~100. m alongside major highways in the interests of protecting human health. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Air quality; Near highway; Resident perceptions; Traffic emissions,Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Male; New Zealand; Residence Characteristics; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vehicle Emissions; New Zealand; North Island; Waikato; exhaust gas; air quality; motorway; perception; public attitude; residential location; traffic emission; air pollution; air quality; Article; exhaust gas; health impact assessment; highway; human; New Zealand; noise measurement; perception; semi structured interview; social status; suburban area; suburban population; traffic noise; wellbeing; work environment; demography; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; female; male; questionnaire; risk factor,,Scopus

The local government addressed this problem by adopting a city-wide driving restriction policy. Starting from 2010, a congestion charge policy has been under discussion. While Beijing's municipality has tried to bring traffic-related smog under control with these regulatory and market-based policies, there has been significant public opposition to both policies. Public acceptance is critical to successful policy making and implementation; however, the literature offers little insight into the key elements influencing public acceptance in the context of multiple policy choices. Based on a questionnaire survey of 285 respondents in Beijing, this paper adopts ordered logistic regression to explore the key factors influencing public acceptance of driving restriction and congestion charge policies. The results show that the public in Beijing prefers the driving restriction policy to the congestion charge policy. Political concerns, such as concerns relating to policy making transparency and perceived fairness, as well as economic concerns, such as concerns relating to car ownership and extra traffic cost, are essential determinants of public acceptance of such policies. Specifically, citizens who are more concerned about equity hold stronger negative opinions on the congestion charge policy.",Public acceptance; Policy instrument; Smog control; Driving restriction; Congestion charge,,POLITICAL TRUST; AUTHORITARIAN RESPONSIVENESS; NUCLEAR-POWER; AIR-POLLUTION; ATTITUDES; CONSULTATION; PERCEPTIONS; RESIDENTS; AWARENESS; BEHAVIOR,WOS

Results: The more severe the perceived impact of PM on health, the more frequently both Korean and Chinese persons sought PM information. For both groups, there were significant correlations between the perceived severity of health impact and diversity of means of information acquisition. Conclusion: In both China and Korea, awareness of PM may be increased via information provided by newspapers, neighbors and acquaintances, social media, government warning messages, and real-time monitoring applications.

By analyzing correlations between concentrations of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, O-3 and SO2) and related microblogs (air-pollution-related and health-related), it was found that the public is most sensitive to changes in PM2.5 concentration from the perspectives of both China as a whole and individual provinces. Correlations between air pollution and related microblogs were also stronger when and where air quality was worse, and they were also affected by socioeconomic factors such as population, economic conditions and education.

A representative UK survey of adults investigated associations between reported flooding and air pollution (in the participants' local area, by the participant personally, and/or by family and close friends) and climate change concerns (CCC) and perceptions of its health impacts (PIH). In regression analyses controlling for socio-demographic factors and health status, exposure was associated with greater CCC and more negative PIH. Compared to those with low CCC, participants who reported local-area exposure were significantly more likely to be fairly (OR 2.07, 95%CI 1.26, 3.40) or very concerned (OR 3.40, 95%CI 2.02, 5.71).

Moreover, while many respondents believed that action is needed today to avoid climate change (regardless of cause), roughly a quarter held the view that if climate change is real and serious, we will be able to stop it in the future when it happens, just as we did with common air pollution. In addition to assessing respondents' understanding of how long carbon dioxide and common air pollution stay in the atmosphere, we also explored the extent to which people correctly identified causes of climate change and how their beliefs affect support for action. With climate change at the forefront of politics and mainstream media, informing discussions of policy is increasingly important. Confusion about the causes and consequences of climate change, and especially about carbon dioxide's long atmospheric residence time, could have profound implications for sustained support of policies to achieve reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases.",Air pollution; atmospheric residence time; carbon dioxide,,GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; PEOPLE KNOW; CHANGE RISK; KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE,WOS

This is especially notable, given that the PM2.5 warning was issued 89 times during 2016. Because of this, the South Korean government is seeking to enforce a policy of reducing the number of PM2.5 warnings by half using various policy instruments from now until 2022. This article tries to obtain information about the public value of the enforcement. For this purpose, household willingness to pay (WTP) for the enforcement is investigated, applying the contingent valuation (CV) approach. A survey of 1000 households was carried out in South Korean urban areas. The data on the WTP were gathered using a dichotomous choice question and analyzed employing the spike model. The mean WTP estimate is obtained as KRW 5591 (USD 4.97) per household per year, which is statistically significant. The total public value expanded to the population amounts to KRW 98.9 billion (USD 87.8 million) per year.

However, the lack of public and political support for these policies is often a significant obstacle to their introduction. In this article, we present the results of two studies. First, we investigated the public acceptability of three policies to reduce urban air pollution: pedestrianization, low emission zones and congestion charges. Second, based on an experimental online survey, we examined the effect of various framing conditions on the acceptability of congestion charges. The results show, first, that public acceptability is higher for pedestrianization and low emission zones and lower for congestion charging. Second, we find a positive effect on acceptability of information emphasizing the benefits of congestion charges and of positive labelling, comparing the wording “environmental contribution” with “urban toll”; and a negative effect of making political ideology prominent. Our findings suggest that while some interventions aimed at mitigating urban air pollution may be more readily supported than others, their acceptability can be enhanced (or diminished) through careful design and effective communication. © 2023 Federacion Espanola de Sociologia.

We draw on a questionnaire survey of about 1300 residents from 26 neighborhoods in Beijing, where driving restriction policies have been implemented and congestion pricing policies under consideration. This research reveals that residents living in neighborhoods with high population density and low diversity of land uses and those proximity to transit service and in the central urban areas tend to more strongly support the congestion pricing policy. Residents who perceive serious air pollution and who believe in the policy effectiveness are more supportive to the pricing policy; they may pay more attention to the level of air pollution caused by congestion caused by driving.

Understanding awareness of air pollution and support for environmental protection from the general public is essential for informing governmental approaches to dealing with this problem. This study presents a cross-sectional survey conducted in the Klang Valley and Iskandar conurbations to examine urban Malaysians' perception, awareness and opinions of air pollution. The survey was conducted in two languages, English and Malay, and administered through the online survey research software, Qualtrics. The survey consisted of three sections, where we collected sociodemographic information, information on the public perception of air quality and the causes of air pollution, information on public awareness of air pollution and its related impacts, and information on attitudes towards environmental protection. Of 214 respondents, over 60% were positive towards the air quality at both study sites despite the presence of harmful levels of air pollution. The air in the Klang Valley was perceived to be slightly more polluted and causing greater health issues. Overall, the majority of respondents were aware that motor vehicles represent the primary pollution source, yet private transport was still the preferred choice of transportation mode. A generally positive approach towards environmental protection emerged from the data. However, participants showed stronger agreement with protection actions that do not involve individual effort. Nonetheless, we found that certain segments of the sample (people owning more than three vehicles per household and those with relatives who suffered from respiratory diseases) were significantly more willing to personally pay for environmental protection compared to others. Implications point to the need for actions for spreading awareness of air pollution to the overall population, especially with regards to its health risks, as well as strategies for increasing the perception of behavioural control, especially with regards to motor vehicles' usage.",,,PERCEIVED BEHAVIORAL-CONTROL; WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; COEFFICIENT-ALPHA; KLANG VALLEY; ATTITUDES; KNOWLEDGE; HEALTH; INDONESIA; QUALITY,WOS

We considered the disparity among gender, age and education level in four main aspects, viz. sources of access to information, knowledge and risk perception about air pollution and willingness to change and act for mitigation. Social media was a primary source of access to information regarding air pollution in Muscat. Further, the majority of the respondents were aware of the meaning of air pollution and interested in the issue of air quality, while females have a higher level of air pollution awareness than males. Over 94% of respondents were disturbed by air pollution from vehicles and other sources. Males and older participants have significantly higher level of interest about air quality information. The majority pay attention to air quality when they move outdoors but females are more susceptible than males to the effects of air pollution. Majority recognized the air pollution is always dangerous to their health, yet participants with higher education level have a higher risk perception of air pollution. Breathing contaminated air was the most common pathway of exposure to the toxic air pollutants reported by participants. Over 90% of participants care about air quality when they are performing outdoor sports activities. Most of the participants reported that they did not use public transportation to move within Muscat Governorate, their major transportation mode being private vehicle.

Among the policy measures that can be put in place to limit air pollutant emissions, end-of-pipe technologies and/or regulatory instruments may be implemented through legislative acts. Also, equally important are behavioural measures, requiring citizens' active involvement. The success of any measure to limit pollutant emissions requires the acceptance by the citizens that, in turn, implies a correct perception of the main pollutant emission drivers. We present here the comparison between the public perception of air pollution sources and the real-world situation through a survey carried out in seven European countries and involving 16 101 respondents. Our study shows a dramatic underestimation of the contribution of the agri-food sector to air pollution.

However, the lack of information on indoor air quality in frequently visited enclosed spaces (private premises, workplaces and common areas, transportation) often leads to subjective diagnoses, exacerbated by the difficulty in identifying the sources of indoor air pollution. Nevertheless, it must be regarded as a public health issue, as reflected by growing anxiety among parents about the quality of the air their children breathe inside school buildings, for example. In this context, more robust legislation and standards are considered indispensable in ensuring better prevention and risk assessment. © 2020, Institut Veolia Environnement.

However, in-depth research on the public's perception of smog has not yet been conducted. A survey of residents living around eight state-controlled atmospheric environmental monitoring sites in Ningbo City was conducted using stratified sampling. The data was statistically analyzed to investigate people's views and behavioral tendencies in smog weather, the influence of different media reports on public outlook, and public opinions on the local atmosphere and pollution management in different areas. The results showed that people's perception of smog differs greatly from actual conditions, indicating that the public opinion tends to deviate when faced with a public crisis. Mainstream media (TV, newspaper, etc.), accounting for 67% of all media sources, are the main source for dissemination of smog information. The main sources of pollution, in order of decreasing contribution, according to residents of Ningbo City are as follows: motor vehicle exhaust, industrial coal combustion, large-scale construction, biomass burning, and kitchen fumes.Implications: Since 2011, most areas of China have been affected by frequent smog. Most research on smog has been concentrated on its causes, alert systems, and prevention measures, whereas in-depth research on the public perception of smog has not yet been conducted. When a risky environmental event such as smog occurs, consequences may be more serious than the event itself will cause if people take irrational measures because of lacking relevant knowledge.

We apply the theoretical elements of the Health Belief Model (HBM) to improve risk communication about ambient air pollution. We discuss the practical applications of HBM, in tandem with the principles of health communication, within an environmental health context. Methods: We test the predictive power of selected components related to the HBM (perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and cues to action) for intentions to seek information about ambient air quality. We surveyed 325 individuals throughout Nevada where poor air quality poses a risk for vulnerable populations. Results: Ordinal logistic regression analyses showed that experiencing mucous membrane symptoms (eye itching, nose irritation, and dry throat/cough), perceived severity to future health threats, and having an at-risk member in the household positively and significantly predicted intentions to seek air quality information. Experiencing neuropsychological symptoms (fatigue, feeling heavy-headed, and nausea/dizziness), and having a cardiovascular or a respiratory condition did not have significant effects on reported intentions.

The mechanism behind this hypothesis is that public acceptance of mitigation policies constitutes a crucial limiting factor, necessitating ancillary gains such as clean air for mitigation policy to be politically robust. However, the public's preference for local pollution mitigation and concomitant failure to appreciate the benefits of global warming mitigation is assumed rather than demonstrated. In this paper, we show, first, that people distinguish between the physical manifestations of air pollution and global warming, and second, that they see both phenomena as arising from the same causes as well as having negative impacts on humans. Specifically, using a survey experimental design with open-ended questions in an urban Chinese setting, we demonstrate that citizens relate glacier melt and sea-level rise to global warming, while linking the local phenomenon of smog almost exclusively to air pollution. At the same time, respondents link impacts on humans and vehicle/industrial pollution topics with both air pollution and global warming. These findings are relevant to decision-makers as they suggest that the public values mitigation of global warming in its own right.

This study aims to ascertain the way in which the public perceives risks related to climate change and adopts behaviors to respond to the issue. Using city smog as an example, this study proposes a conceptual model that integrates the theory of planned behavior (TPB), smog knowledge and risk perception. It aims to elucidate determinants of smog-reduction behavior. Data were obtained through questionnaire surveys. The results confirm the relationships among the core variables of the TPB and risk perception. Firstly, they confirm that TPB is an effective model for predicting responses to city smog, and secondly, they show that risk perception is significantly positive in predicting attitude and behavioral intention. In addition, our analysis confirms that knowledge about smog is a positive antecedent variable in risk perception, attitude, and perceived behavioral control. The paper contributes to the extension of the TPB model and to the enrichment of its application in the context of city smog. It also has practical implications both for people experiencing city smog, and for authorities such as local governments and environmental organizations.

In this paper, we conducted a systematic study on the coping behaviors of college students' outdoor physical exercise under the haze weather in Henan Province, China. The reference survey, questionnaire survey, interview, data measurement and data statistics were used to compile a questionnaire on the outdoor physical exercise response behavior of college students under the haze weather in Henan Province. The current situation of outdoor physical exercise response behaviors of ten universities in Henan Province under the haze weather was investigated. It was found that a total of 1,000 questionnaires were issued and 872 valid questionnaires were returned. The effective response rate was 87.2%. which has good validity. There is a positive con-elation between college students' perception of smog and college students' active participation in outdoor physical exercise. Most college students were able to actively participate in physical exercises under the haze weather, and the proportion of girls who chose to resist coping behavior was about 8.0% higher than that of boys (P<0.01). This result shows that female college students are more likely to give up outdoor physical exercise when encountering haze weather. Physical exercise behavior has little to do with age. Freshmen like to take risky coping behaviors, while seniors tend to resist coping behaviors. Students who rarely participate in physical exercises still choose to resist coping behaviors when faced with haze weather, while students who actively participate in physical exercises tend to choose risky coping behaviors. The students who choose to resist the coping behavior have the highest proportion of light participation in sports, about 29.41%. The students who choose risky coping behaviors are mostly non-persistent high-intensity physical exercises, accounting for about 49.45%. In a word, through this research, we can put forward suggestions for outdoor physical exercise in haze weather according to the different characteristics of college students, and finally find a new method suitable for college students' outdoor physical exercise coping behavior under haze weather.",Haze weather; college students; outdoor exercise; coping behavior; case analysis,,SYMPTOMS; QUALITY; LIFE,WOS

The eastern portions of the country are relatively insulated from the harmful effects of PM2.5 emissions due to northwest winds which cause air pollutants generated from coal-fired power plants to be carried out to the East Sea (Sea of Japan). Consequently, our sample group was divided into central, western, eastern, and southern regions, and a contingent valuation method, combined with a double-bounded dichotomous choice, was used to derive people's WTP for the mitigation of PM2.5 emissions. Our estimation results indicated that respondents who live in eastern regions showed a significantly lower WTP (about KRW 1280/month) than the mean WTP of other regions (above KRW 1337/month). Thus, we suggest that the current Seasonal Management System of PM2.5 emissions should be modified to consider regional differences. Statistical results from this study reinforce our suggestions-almost 78 percent of survey respondents support a revision of the current SMS policy and are in favor of a revised SMS policy-one that exempts eastern regions from a nationwide shutdown of coal-fired generation from December to March.

The data were calibrated by SPSS 23 using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple regression analyses. The results show that most people found particulate matter to be an important problem but were unable to do sufficient mitigation action to prevent its presence. Residents showed greater psychological stress resulting in difficulty going out than physical symptoms. The most influential factor on response behaviors was psychological attributes.

Three studies were multicenter investigations, while five articles were based on a national-level survey. The air quality (AQ) was assessed by monitoring stations (n= 24) or dispersion models (n= 7). Many studies were population questionnaire-based, air monitoring and time-series studies, and web-based investigations. A direct association between exposure and perception emerged in 20 studies. This systematic review has shown that most of the studies establish a relationship between risk perception measurement. A broad spectrum of concepts and notions related to perception also emerged, which is undoubtedly an indicator of the wealth of available knowledge and is promising for future research.",air pollution exposure; particulate matter (pm); environmental epidemiology; environmental pollution; perception; risk perception; public health policy; systematic review,,QUALITY PERCEPTION; PUBLIC PERCEPTION; HEALTH; DETERMINANTS; POLICY; AREAS; CHINA; ASSOCIATION; ENVIRONMENT; PEDESTRIANS,WOS

A questionnaire survey based on accidental sampling to explore risk perception and willingness to pay (WTP) for self-protection and haze management was conducted via face-to-face interview of 250 households, in one urban and four rural areas (covering one rural plain and three different levels of highland areas). Data were analyzed using the contingent valuation method, a one-way ANOVA, correlation, and stepwise multiple linear regression. Key findings on risk perception found that urban respondents living in the lowest areas were more familiar with and experienced more effects from serious haze, while having the least trust in the local authority's management to cope with the situation. Influential factors determining familiarity and effect for people in most areas were their harm and severe haze experiences. Comparing WTP for a mask, an air purifier, and local authorities support, respondents in all areas were mainly willing to pay for a mask; this was influenced by various factors. The highest average price of willingness to pay was found in the urban area. The important significant factors that increased WTP for self-protection of urban respondents was severe haze experience, while rural respondents who had a longer stay duration, including married farmers in highland areas with less education, tended to have less WTP for self-protection but more WTP for haze management. Avoiding crop residue burning is the first strategy that should be used to deal with haze pollution. Early burning schedules of the highland people should be formally announced, and prompt risk communication should be implemented by local and central authorities and media practitioners.",risk perception; haze pollution; willingness to pay; self-protection; haze management; Thailand,,AIR-POLLUTION; CONTINGENT VALUATION; MITIGATION; QUALITY; DETERMINANTS; CHINA,WOS

Method: A cross-sectional convenience sample survey was conducted among 302 outdoor exercisers in May 2015. Descriptive analysis was used to describe demographics, outdoor physical activity patterns, knowledge of PM2.5 and risk reduction behaviors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was then used to explore factors that influence the adoption of risk reduction behaviors. Results: The most common behavior to reduce PM2.5 exposure was minimizing the times for opening windows on hazy days (75.5%), and the least common one was using air purifiers (19.3%). Two thirds of respondents indicated that they wore face masks when going outside in the haze (59.5%), but only 13.6% of them would wear professional antismog face masks. Participants adopting risk reduction behaviors regarding PM2.5 exposure tended to be females, 50-60 year-olds, those with higher levels of knowledge about PM2.5 and those who had children. Conclusions: These findings indicate the importance of improving knowledge about PM2.5 among outdoor exercisers. Educational interventions should also be necessary to guide the public to take appropriate precautionary measures when undertaking outdoor exercise in high PM2.5 pollution areas.",risk reduction behavior; PM2.5; outdoor exercisers; influencing factors; China,,POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; AIR-POLLUTION; PARTICULATE MATTER; INDIVIDUAL EXPOSURE; HEALTH-RISKS; LUNG-CANCER; MORTALITY; INDOOR; HAZE; ASSOCIATION,WOS

In this study, we propose an integrated framework to figure out the roles of socio-physical environments in promoting air quality control policies through behavioral perspectives. The study selects Changhua County in Central Taiwan, composed of 26 cities and townships, as a case study to investigate the impacts of social and economic factors and the air quality on individual's knowledge, attitude and behavioral intention. The socioeconomic and environmental factors are collected from Taiwanese official information, while the knowledge, attitude, and intention toward the policies are obtained through questionnaires. Subsequently, multivariate analysis techniques including principal component analysis and redundancy analysis are utilized to simultaneously identify the causal relationships between socio-physical environments and the knowledge, attitude, and intention in different townships. Our findings suggest that individual's knowledge, attitude, and intention toward the air polices cannot be raised simply in commensurate with the growth of the economy and the deterioration of air quality. Indeed, people living in highly urbanized regions and being well-educated, particularly in Changhua City, are less willing to take actions for air quality improvement although they are susceptible to environmental risks. On the contrary, people close to nature have more environmental knowledge, positive attitudes and more intentions to improve the air quality. The finding results will be beneficial to authorities in each city/township to organize environmental education plans corresponding to their socioeconomic conditions and behavioral patterns.

A study was conducted in four governorates in Oman, viz. Muscat, Al Dakhiliyah, north and south Al Batinah, in the 2022/2023 academic year. A closed online questionnaire was used with a total of 1,337 respondents from grades 9th, 10th, & 11th. The results of the study showed that the level of students’ awareness regarding air pollution and its health effects was moderate. Significant differences in students’ awareness of air pollution and its health effects due to gender and grade variables were obtained. Female students were more vulnerable than males to the effects of air pollution, hence they were significantly careful about air quality when doing outdoor sports activities. In contrast, male students’ awareness of the schools’ role regarding air pollution awareness and reduction actions was significantly higher than female students. Social media was a main source of access to information about air pollution. Inhaling contaminated air was the most common route of exposure to the toxic air pollutants reported by participants. © 2024 © 2024 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

There were few research on the role of government factors and the issue of intention-action inconsistency in the context of PM mitigation action. Therefore, this study set not only variables in the risk perception paradigm but also ones in government factors as independent variables, while intention and action in response to PM were set as dependent variables. This study's analysis was based on survey data collected from Korean people. For representativeness of the samples, this study adopted the quota sampling method, considering region, gender, and age. Five hundred respondents finished the survey. To verify the hypotheses, this study used regression and binomial logistic analysis. Analysis showed that (1) negative emotions, trust, knowledge, government competency, policy satisfaction, and policy awareness had significant effects on intention and action in response to PM, and (2) perceived benefits only affected intention, whereas government accountability only affected action. Logistic analysis showed that there were groups in which intentions and actions did not match. Negative emotions and government competence induce intention-action consistency, whereas the perceived benefits and trust in government tend to encourage inconsistency. Knowledge is a variable that induces both consistency and inconsistency in the intention-action relationship.

The aim of this study was to determine the psychometric properties of the self-care behaviors related to air pollution protection. To this mean, questionnaire responses provided by Iranian college students were analyzed and a Health Belief Model (HBM) determined. Methods The self-care behavior related to air pollution protection was determined from responses from 301 university students using test item characteristics, face validity, reliability (internal consistency) and construct validity. Moreover, we carried out an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine the factorial structure and explained variance. Results Based on Eigenvalues of >= 1.00 and factor loadings of >= 0.40, seven factors were extracted. The calculated Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value was 0.804. Overall, the seven factors explain 66.39% of the variance in the hypothesized model. Cronbach's alpha for the measured factors: the perceived susceptibility, severity, barriers, benefits, self-efficacy, cues to action and behavior were 0.85, 0.79, 0.86, 0.66, 0.74, 0.83, and 0.75, respectively.

This study investigated whether these two coping styles are similarly associated with adjustment across levels of perceived controllability and beyond European-American contexts. During China's peak of air pollution in 2014, we surveyed 250 young- to middle- aged adults online to measure their coping behaviors, smog perceptions, and psychological distress, and collected objective data of pollution severity in the respondents' cities. Results showed that forward-focus coping was generally associated with lower distress and trauma-focus coping was associated with greater distress. Perceived controllability significantly moderated the associations between trauma focus (but not forward focus) and distress. These findings suggest that while forward focus correlated with beneficial adjustment outcomes in coping with air pollution, the extensive processing of event-related cognitions and emotions in trauma focus may be detrimental, especially for events perceived to be less controllable.

Clinicians cite their lack of education as a common barrier. We developed a two-minute animated video on mitigating air pollution health risks and evaluated the efficacy of this video as an educational tool.MethodsIn March-June 2021, a convenience sample of Minnesota interprofessional health learners and clinicians viewed the video and completed an electronic survey that assessed pre-/post-video intervention changes in (a) didactic and clinically applied knowledge on health impacts of air pollution, (b) perceived comfort in identifying at-risk patients and counseling them on relevant preventive health behaviors, (c) intentions/barriers to counseling patients, (d) beliefs and attitudes related to the health harms of air pollution, and (e) perceptions of the overall acceptability of the intervention.ResultsThe 218 participants included learners and clinicians in medicine, nursing, and advanced practice provision. Respondents' knowledge scores and self-reported level of comfort in identifying high-risk patients and counseling them on preventative health behaviors increased significantly pre-/post-intervention. The video also effectively altered participants' misperceptions about the health impacts of air pollution. While less than half of participants (43.6%) reported they intended to engage in counseling patients as a result of watching the video, 52.3% indicated they might do so. Lack of time during clinical encounters and lack of training were reported as persistent barriers to engaging in this counseling. Overall, participants found the video to be an effective educational tool, indicating that they wanted their colleagues and patients to watch the video and would like to see further short, animated videos on other environmental health topics.ConclusionsA two-minute animated educational video significantly improved knowledge of inequitable health impacts of air pollution and improved perceived comfort in identifying and counseling at-risk patients among health professional learners and clinicians regardless of profession, level of training, or pre-intervention knowledge level.

The economic impacts of haze include adverse health effects and disruption to transport and tourism. Previous studies have used a variety of approaches to assess the economic impacts of haze and the forest fires more generally. But no study has used contingent valuation to assess non-market impacts of haze on individuals. Here we apply contingent valuation to estimate impacts of haze on Singapore, one of most severely affected countries. We used a double-bounded dichotomous-choice survey design and the Kaplan-Meier-Turnbull method to infer the distribution of Singaporeans' willingness to pay (WTP) for haze mitigation. Our estimate of mean individual WTP was 0.97% of annual income (n = 390). To calculate total national WTP, we stratified by income, the demographic variable most strongly related to individual WTP. The total WTP estimate was $643.5 million per year (95% CI [$527.7 million, $765.0 million]). This estimate is comparable in magnitude to previously estimated impacts of Indonesia's fires and also to the estimated costs of peatland protection and restoration.

Some argue that smoking restrictions or bans would result in a business drop, assuming > 50% of patrons smoke. Evidence in Nevada and responses from the 2008 California tobacco survey refute this assertion. The present study investigates the proportion of active smokers in southern California tribal casinos, as well as occupancy and PM2.5 levels in smoking and nonsmoking sections. Methods: We measured active-smoker and total-patron counts during Friday or Saturday night visits (two per casino) to smoking and nonsmoking gaming areas inside 11 southern California casinos. We counted slot machines and table games in each section, deriving theoretical maximum capacities and occupancy rates. We also measured PM2.5 concentrations (or used published levels) in both nonsmoking and smoking areas. Results: Excluding one casino visit with extremely high occupancy, we counted 24,970 patrons during 21 casino visits of whom 1,737 were actively smoking, for an overall active- smoker proportion of 7.0% and a small range of similar to 5% across casino visits (minimum of 5% and maximum of 10%). The differences in mean inter-casino active-smoker proportions were not statistically significant. Derived occupancy rates were 24% to 215% in the main (low-stakes) smoking-allowed slot or table areas. No relationship was found between observed active-smoker proportions and occupancy rate. The derived maximum capacities of nonsmoking areas were 1% to 29% of the overall casino capacity (most under 10%) and their observed occupancies were 0.1 to over 3 times that of the main smoking-allowed casino areas. Seven of twelve visits to nonsmoking areas with no separation had occupancy rates greater than main smoking areas. Unenclosed nonsmoking areas don't substantially protect occupants from PM2.5 exposure. Nonsmoking areas encapsulated inside smoking areas or in a separate, but unenclosed, area had PM2.5 levels that were 10 to 60 mu g/m(3) and 6 to 23 mu g/m(3) higher than outdoor levels, respectively, indicating contamination from smoking. Conclusions: Although fewer than roughly 10% of casino patrons are actively smoking on average, these individuals substantially increase PM2.5 exposure for all patrons in smoking and unenclosed nonsmoking areas. Nonsmoking areas may be too inconvenient, small, or undesirable to serve a substantial number of nonsmoking patrons. Imposing indoor smoking bans, or contained smoking areas with a maximum capacity of up to 10% of the total patronage, would offer protection from PM2.5 exposures for nonsmoking patrons and reduce employee exposures.",Secondhand smoke; Fine particles; Active smoker counts; Nonsmoking gaming,,ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO-SMOKE; SECONDHAND SMOKE; AIR-POLLUTION; EXPOSURE,WOS

Indoor particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with SHS exposure and is used as a proxy measure. However, PM2.5 is non-specific and influenced by a number of environmental factors, which are subject to geographical variation. The nature of association between SHS exposure and indoor PM2.5-studied primarily in high-income countries (HICs) context-may not be globally applicable. We set out to explore this association in a low/middle-income country setting, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among households with at least one resident smoker. We inquired whether smoking was permitted inside the home (smoking-permitted homes, SPH) or not (smoke-free homes, SFH), and measured indoor PM2.5 concentrations using a low-cost instrument (Dylos DC1700) for at least 22 hours. We describe and compare SPH and SFH and use multiple linear regression to evaluate which variables are associated with PM2.5 level among all households. Results We surveyed 1746 households between April and August 2018; 967 (55%) were SPH and 779 (45%) were SFH. The difference between PM2.5 values for SFH (median 27 mu g/m(3), IQR 25) and SPH (median 32 mu g/m(3), IQR 31) was 5 mu g/m(3) (p<0.001). Lead participant's education level, being a non-smoker, having outdoor space and smoke-free rule at home and not using kerosene oil for cooking were significantly associated with lower PM2.5.

In order to ensure the smog governance projects could be promoted smoothly and the public shoulder the environmental responsibilities consciously, it is necessary for the policymakers to take public attitude into consideration, and understand the public willingness to pay (WTP) for smog mitigation. This paper adopts a CV method framework to assess the value of WTP and analyze the determinants. Given the consideration of the possible presence of the selectivity bias caused by protest responses, the bivariate sample selection model is constructed for estimation. Results show that up to 14% of respondents hold the protest responses, and neglecting the selection bias caused by protest responses would lead to downward biased estimates. The mean value of WTP for the smog mitigation is 1590.36 RMB per year, accounting for about 1% of annual income. Moreover, the NIMBY (not in my backyard) attitude among public is found to be significantly correlated with their WTP, and the other determinants such as household annual income, energy expenditure and economic loss caused by smog could also substantially affect the value of WTP. We further recommend grading governance and policy transparency to address the smog crisis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, limited attention has been paid to ensuring that the information is provided to the public in a format that is understandable and relevant to their needs. This research has begun the task of determining the nature and extent of public air quality requirements by performing a social survey (using a postal questionnaire) to provide a basic snapshot of the public's views and by determining the views of information providers and interested professionals. The paper identities the main shortcomings in current public air quality information provision. The social survey and workshop results demonstrate that current information provision and dissemination does not match public requirements; the depth and breadth of local information needs to be enhanced. Local authorities need to improve their co-ordination and collaboration, the role of the mass-media needs to be considered carefully, air quality needs to be better described and its implications for individuals spelled out and certain public groups need special consideration. In addition, local authorities need more guidance on communicating air quality, possibly through a best practice guide. Further research is required to identify the best descriptors for air quality, to improve the effectiveness of public advice during episodes of poor air quality and to use public air quality information to effect behavioral changes.

In working with community members, the goal of this study was to identify the air pollution issues (both indoors and outdoors) of concern within these two regions. Over a two-year period, 328 air quality surveys were disseminated within seven communities in rural Alaska. The surveys focused on understanding the demographics, home heating practices, indoor activities, community/outdoor activities, and air quality perceptions within each community. Results from these surveys showed that there is elevated potential for PM10/PM2.5 exposures in rural Alaska communities. Top indoor air quality concerns included mold, lack of ventilation or fresh air, and dust. Top outdoor air pollution concerns identified were open burning/smoke, road dust, and vehicle exhaust (e.g., snow machines, ATVs, etc.).

Risk perception is one of the most important indicators of the public's concern about air pollution. However, there existed few studies exploring the spatial distribution of risk perception. To fill the gap, psychometric paradigm methods was adopted to assess the public's risk perception of air pollution. A nationwide empirical study was conducted from December 2016 to February 2017 and 10,653 completed questionnaires were collected. According to a series of screening strategies, 9744 qualified questionnaires were included as a sample, which covered 31 China provinces (Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan were not included in this study). We found that 45% of the respondents were dissatisfied with the current air quality, many respondents concerned a lot about air pollution (76%) and worried about the harmful consequences of being exposed to air pollution (86%). There was significant difference in the public's risk perception and attitude toward air pollution among different regions: the respondents in the northeast region, northern coastal region, eastern coastal region and Middle Yellow river region perceived higher air pollution risk and lower satisfaction with air quality than other regions; and the public's trust in the government increased from coastal regions to inland regions. In addition, the hierarchical linear model (HLM) was used to explore the effects of demographic, environmental and economic factors on public risk perception and attitude toward air pollution. Based on this, the characteristics of sensitive populations regarding air pollution were identified. What's more, we found that PM2.5 has a positive influence on perceived risk factor (PR) and can strengthen the positive correlation between PR and satisfaction Iwith air quality (SAQ). Finally, policy implications behind these results were discussed, which can provide references and lay the foundation for policymakers and subsequent researchers.

Text analysis can serve as an important means to decipher stakeholder (dis)agreements. Traditionally, researchers analyze texts using qualitative text analysis. Relying only on qualitative text analysis can no longer be sufficient to handle very large amounts of textual data. Now computational methods can be applied to help extract opinions in electronic texts. Our paper adopts a big data computational text analysis approach (keyword analysis, keyword co-occurrence, thematic analysis), based on a corpus of 2.4 million words, to compare concerns towards air pollution among three stakeholder groups (i.e. the government (GOV), the environmental groups (NGO) and the news media (MEDIA)) in Hong Kong, between 2002 and 2012, a period when air pollution was subject to rigorous policy debates and discussions. Our analysis shows the somewhat different concerns of the stakeholders. The stakeholders focus heavily on emissions and end-of-pipe pollution control. Though the advocation of sustainability since 1990s, the government-led command-and-control approach still dictates the discourse. Sustainability is featured more intensively by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government. Transboundary pollution (e.g. from Guangdong, China) is not a major concern for all stakeholder groups. Public health is a greater concern in MEDIA, as compared to the other two stakeholder groups. Future air pollution policy-making may direct more of its attention to the pressing concerns over the negative impacts of air pollution on health and its associated costs, with health experts getting more closely involved in the regulatory decision-makings. More information should be given to vulnerable groups, such as young children or workers in polluted environments. To better relate differential health risks of pollution in everyday life, both local and international governments should consider developing more personalized air pollution monitoring and health management systems for their citizens in future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Air pollution; Big data; Computational text analysis; Personalisation; Public health; Stakeholder concerns,air pollution; article; attention; big data; child; decision making; government; health care management; health hazard; Hong Kong; human; monitoring; pollution control; public health; thematic analysis; worker,,Scopus

We studied whether the frequency of symptoms reported across students at school level mediates the relationship between observed mold and dampness in a school building and students' subjective IAQ. To answer this research question, we tested a multilevel path model. The analyzed data were created by merging two nationwide data sets: (a) survey data from students, including information on subjective IAQ (N = 24,786 students); (b) data from schools, including information on mold and dampness in a school building (N = 222). After the background variables were adjusted, schools' observed mold and dampness were directly and significantly related to poor subjective IAQ (standardized beta (beta)= 0.22,P = .002). In addition, in schools with mold and dampness, students reported significantly more symptoms (beta = 0.22,P = .023) than in schools without; the higher the prevalence of symptoms at school level, the worse the students' subjective IAQ (beta = 0.60,P < .001). This indirect path was significant (P = .023). In total, schools' observed mold and dampness and student-reported symptoms explained 52% of the between-school variance in subjective IAQ.",dampness; indoor air quality; indoor environmental problems; multilevel analysis; school; symptoms,,ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY; ODOR; ADVANTAGES; FRAMEWORK; EXPOSURE; CHILDREN; COMFORT; HEALTH; ASTHMA,WOS

However, few studies use appropriate designs to deal with endogeneity issues, a situation that raises serious questions on the validity of their findings. To overcome this problem, this study uses the instrumental variables method to test the effect of perceived threats and response efficacy on adaptation to smog episodes. The results of this study show that the conjunction of a moderate to high perception of threats with a high perception of response efficacy is positively associated with the adoption of the recommended behavior. The increase of perceived threats does not seem to have an effect on the behavior of individuals with low response efficacy perception. Moreover, change in perceived response efficacy does not lead to any change in the behavior of individuals with low threat perceptions. Concerning policy implications, this study suggests that smog warnings and health communication campaigns could be more effective if they provide accurate information simultaneously on air pollution level, its adverse effects, and advice on how to mitigate these effects.",Air pollution; protection motivation theory; response efficacy perception; smog adaptation; smog warning; threat perception,,CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY; AIR-POLLUTION; FEAR APPEALS; PERCEPTION; MODEL; RISK,WOS

This study aims at determining the causal relationship between risk perceptions about particulate matter and outdoor activity satisfaction in South Korea. An Internet survey was conducted with 412 people, and a structural equation model was used to perform confirmatory factor analysis. The statistically significant results show that the perceived risk of particulate matter is higher when people do not show interest in or trust public opinion or policy on the subject. This increases people's perceptions of health risks, which in turn lowers their satisfaction with outdoor activity. Although trust levels in public opinion or policy had a positive impact on outdoor activity satisfaction, this was not statistically significant. These results are expected to contribute to risk communication guidelines in public opinion reporting and to the direction of environmental health policies in developing countries with high levels of air pollution, such as particulate matter.",air pollution; outdoor activities satisfaction scale (OASS); PM10; PM2; 5; South Korea; structural equation model (SEM),,AIR; POLLUTION; QUALITY; PM10; SMOG,WOS

We found evidence of a home halo effect even though studies show indoor pollution in these municipalities might be equal to or higher than outdoor pollution. The findings are relevant for local and central governments to improve their communication strategies, which to date have been focused on providing data about outdoor air pollution aggregated at the city level.

However, in the current context of cities' efforts to attract talent in China, research on the impact of air pollution on the flow or dwelling willingness of young talent is relatively limited. Based on the theory of planned behavior and from the perspective of subjective perception, this paper uses a regulated model to explore the impact mechanism of air pollution perception on young talent urban settlement intentions. Taking Hangzhou as a case, this study surveyed 987 individuals who were classified as young talent to explore the impact of air pollution perception on urban settlement intentions in China. The research shows that air pollution perception has a significant impact on young talent urban settlement intentions, and this impact is achieved through the intermediary effect of residential satisfaction. Place attachment of young talent to cities cannot significantly regulate the impact of air pollution perception on residential satisfaction, but it can significantly regulate the relationship between residential satisfaction and urban settlement intentions. That is to say, although place attachment cannot reduce the decline in residential satisfaction brought by air pollution perception, it can weaken the negative impact of air pollution perception on dwelling willingness through a decline in residential satisfaction.

Data were collected (n = 2010) from 13 Chinese cities with varying air pollution gradients using questionnaires. The results demonstrated that air pollution was significantly correlated with people's risk perception and concern about air pollution, which significantly affected their pro-environmental behaviour (PEB). However, high-risk perceptions undermine the public's self-efficacy and reduce people's PEB in the private sphere. People with high scores of the authoritarian personality type were reluctant to engage in PEB in the private sphere; interestingly, it can also be transformed into a stronger PEB in the public sphere via social norms. Thus, this study suggests that educational activities can break the negative link between authoritarianism and environmentalism, leading to behavioural change. Hence, it is essential for education programs to harvest positive outcomes via adaptive approaches for varying authoritarian personalities.",air pollution; authoritarian; personality; pro-environmental behaviour; risk perception,,DOMINANCE ORIENTATION; RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR; QUALITY PERCEPTION; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; RISK PERCEPTION; FEAR APPEALS; CHINA; ATTITUDES; DETERMINANTS; ASSOCIATION,WOS

In this study, we use a multiregional and multisectoral computable general equilibrium model (CGE model) to simulate the effects of different levels of resident tourism subsidy policies on the economy and environment in China. Our analysis shows that tourism subsidies are beneficial to economic growth and support the transition to a low-carbon society. In addition, resident tourism subsidy policy has a positive effect on the national emission reduction of CO2, CO, NOX, PM2.5, and SO2. At the regional level, more significant emission reduction potential is present in provinces with more energy consumption and a more developed heavy industry, such as Shandong, Guizhou, and Inner Mongolia. Therefore, this study indicates that resident tourism subsidies can be an effective policy suggestion to promote the transition to a green society and air pollutant emission reduction. © 2023 by the authors.",CGE model; economic impact; environmental impact; tourism subsidy,China; Guizhou; Mongolia; Nei Monggol; Shandong; atmospheric pollution; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic impact; emission; environmental impact; subsidy system; tourism,,Scopus

Using large-scale geo-referenced survey data, collected in the Bohai Rim area of China (including 43 cities), we found that a standard deviation decrease in the number of polluted days over a year was associated with about a 15 percent increase in the odds of reporting a higher degree of happiness, after controlling for a wide range of individual- and city-scale covariate effects. On average, urban residents in the Bohai Rim region were willing to pay roughly 1.42 percent of their average monthly household income for mitigating marginal reductions in air pollution, although great spatial variability was also presented.

In the conducted research, decisions regarding both business and private trips were evaluated. In addition, information on factors that could increase the respondents' interest in the condition of air quality in the city of the intended trip (e.g., trip with children, trip length) was collected. Due to the fact that tourism is a significant source of income for many cities, the research results presented in the article may be of significant importance for entities creating the urban tourist product and responsible for its management.

While increasing studies are being conducted on the behaviors leading to PM2.5 toxicity from the perspective of environmental toxicants, there is a lack of research on factors influencing anti-PM2.5 behavioral intentions. Thus, this study aims to narrow this gap by adapting the theory of planned behavior framework to investigate the effects of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control on protective behavioral intentions against PM2.5. In total, 1277 online questionnaires were collected from parents of young children living in urban and rural areas of Beijing, and the data was analyzed using correlation, regression, and path analyses.

It's now widely acknowledged that air pollution has an ineligible influence on the psychological well-being of citizens beyond its wellestablished physical impact. We explored how fine particulate matter (PM2.5), an essential air pollutant associated with morbidity and mortality, interacted with aspects of risk perception to influence citizen's mental stress level. Questionnaire data from 508 Nanjing citizens in China were collected across four seasons within an 18-month period. We found no evidence that mental stress was directly influenced by real-time PM(2.5 )exposure. However, path analysis revealed that mental stress was subjected to the indirect influence of physical symptoms (beta = 0.076, p = 0.11), by increasing perceived effect on health and increasing attribution to indoor pollution sources (beta = 0.038, p = 0.005). Indoor attribution of PM(2.5 )pollution was associated with perceived familiarity with risk (beta = -0.095, p = 0.033), whereas outdoor attribution was associated with perceived control of risk (beta = 0.091, p = 0.041). Public risk acceptable rate (PRAR) decreased as PM2.5 concentration increased. In females, but not males, greater trust for government was associated with the increased acceptance of PM2. 5 (Year(2017):beta = -0.19, p = 0.003; Year(2022): beta = -0.21, p < 0.001). Using psychological statistical methods, our study implied that air pollution has a substantial association with psychological wellbeing in various ways, which might provide some references for public healthcare and risk communication.

350,,The effect of selected factors on adaptive behavioural responses to urban air pollution in Malaysia,Sahrir S.; Abdullah A.M.; Ponrahono Z.; Sharaai A.H.,2020,,12.0,5,"Urban air pollution is a primary concern throughout the world due to the upsurge of urban populations and high traffic volumes in urban regions. Urban air pollution is created by the failure of the public and the environment to respond to the amount of waste produced in relatively small areas throughout high population density and concentration. The intention of this study was to examine the effect of selected factors (perceived vulnerability, perceived severity, self-efficacy and response efficacy) on adaptive behaviour to urban air pollution. The respondents (N = 450) answered a face-to-face questionnaire survey. The results reveal support for the proposed model, with perceived vulnerability (H1) and self-efficacy (H3) positively predicting adaptive behavioural responses towards urban air quality. The findings specify that there is a significant relationship between perceived vulnerability (ß = 0.246, t = 4.534, P=0.000) and self-efficacy (ß = 0.510, t = 9.653, P=0.000) to adaptive behaviour of the urban community. As a conclusion, this study validates that vulnerability and self-efficacy have a major impact on the adaptive behaviour of the community on urban air pollution in Malaysia. The study makes a significant contribution to the literature by providing evidence of these selected factors as an ideal predictor for adaptive behaviour on air pollution. © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.",Adaptive behaviour; Air pollution; Environmental adaptation; Urban pollution,,,Scopus

Studies have shown the importance of parks for city dwellers to socialize, exercise, relax, and connect with nature. In this study we integrated these two phenomena by investigating whether air pollution impacts park visitation across cities in China. We collected over 17,000 valid responses from 101 cities through an online survey, and used multilevel logit regression and Chi-square test to analyze data. Results showed that although park visits would decrease with increase of pollution, the level of behavior change was not enough to avoid adverse health impact. During slight pollution (75-115 mu g/m3), 93.4% respondents would visit a park as planned. The proportion reduced to 71.0 % for moderate pollution (115-150 mu g/m3), greatly decreased to 38.7% for heavy pollution (150-250 mu g/ m3), and 34.1% for severe pollution (> 250 mu g/m3). We argue that such transitional classification was designed for highly polluted areas to measure pollution mitigation progress, but the terminology slight and moderate are misleading to general public as over 30% respondents did not respond until it reached heavy/severe level. People with lower education and frequent park visitors were more reluctant to cancel park activities due to air pollution. We suggested parks to reduce hours for polluted days and raise awareness on health risk of air pollution through easily digestible information such as infographics. People in cities with lower pollution were less responsive to air pollution to adjust their park visit plan, pointing out the importance to investigate voluntary exposure to polluted air in cities with relatively good air quality.",Air pollution; Urban park; Health behavior; Greenspace; China,China; air quality; atmospheric pollution; greenspace; health risk; morbidity; outdoor recreation; questionnaire survey; urban area; urban pollution; urban population,GREEN SPACE; GLOBAL BURDEN; EXPOSURE; QUALITY; RISK; RESPONSES; BENEFITS; DISEASE; HEALTH; TRENDS,WOS

Furthermore, the stepwise regression method reveals that environmental knowledge is a crucial mediating variable in the relationship between air pollution and environmental behavior. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that age, income, gender, health status, and place of residence significantly impact environmentally friendly behavior. The results remain robust even after controlling for urban fixed effects. The implications of this research suggest that it is opportune to leverage adverse macro events such as regional environmental pollution to promote and enhance public environmental awareness and behaviors, especially for those who are susceptible to environmental pollution.

This paper uses data from the 2017 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS data), exploring the impact of perceived air pollution on labour supply of the migrants based on the perspective of the heterogeneity of different groups' sensitivity to air pollution. After overcoming the reverse causality between perceived air pollution and labour supply using an instrumental variables approach, we find that there is a significant negative effect of perceived air pollution on labour supply. At the same time, this negative effect shows some heterogeneity in terms of the presence of susceptible persons in the family, workers' income levels and household registration. Therefore, in the current economic and social development, in addition to improving measured air quality, it is also necessary to focus on improving the perceived air quality of citizens, as well as improving the working environment of the vulnerable groups in the labour market and protecting their basic labour rights and interests, which is of positive significance for the continuation of the demographic dividend and providing impetus for high-quality and sustainable economic development.",Measured air pollution; Perceived air pollution; Labor supply; China,,WATER-POLLUTION; EXPOSURE; QUALITY,WOS

A period of heavy air pollution in Beijing in January 2013 may have been such a case. This sudden and intense period of air pollution featured historically high levels of fine particulate concentrations and was assumed by observers to be a trigger for shifting public perception and increased pressure for policy adjustment. This study examines whether this period of severe air pollution indeed triggered increased public scrutiny, following which the influential factors behind this development are outlined. In this context, a focus is given to the interplay of air quality, media reporting and public discussion in shaping sustained public interest. Based on a timeline analysis and survey data, it is argued that the combination of historically high air pollution with intense media reporting did lead to higher public attention to the topic. © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2018.",Air pollution; Beijing; China; Focusing events; Media agenda setting,,,Scopus

To achieve global climate-governance goals, it is essential to accelerate the process of peaking carbon emissions and meeting air-quality standards. Despite growing awareness of the impact of low-carbon city policies on the environment, few studies have focused on their impact on urban air quality. Based on panel data drawn from 275 cities between 2011 and 2017, the present study evaluates the effects of a low-carbon city policy on urban sulfur-dioxide emissions, using the low-carbon city policy as a quasi-natural experiment. The findings reveal that urban sulfur-dioxide emissions have obvious spatial-autocorrelation characteristics, showing obvious spatial clustering. The low-carbon city policy not only significantly reduced urban sulfur-dioxide emissions in pilot cities, but also suppressed sulfur-dioxide emissions in surrounding cities through an indirect rebound effect. This paper provides a theoretical reference for collaborative governance, which can help to achieve peak carbon emissions and air-quality standards. To reach those goals, nations must abandon territorial prevention-and-control methods based on administrative divisions and to fully activate cross-city regional joint prevention-and-control measures. This study proposes key policies, including promoting inter-city regional coordination mechanisms, strengthening the collaborative governance in relation to carbon-dioxide and sulfur-dioxide emissions, and promoting the construction of inner-city green facilities.",Carbon emissions; sulfur dioxide; spatial difference-in-differences model; spatial clustering; standard deviation ellipse,,SULFUR-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS; SO2 EMISSIONS; QUALITY; HEALTH; ZONES,WOS

Here, we present the first large-scale study examining preferences and attitudes toward UGS, surveying close to 2000 participants from four cities in three continents (Singapore, Shanghai, London, and Montreal). Contrary to previous beliefs, air quality (and not lack of windows) is the major concern of prospective occupants. Windows, temperature, and lighting emerged as additional important building performance aspects for UGS. Early adopters (ie, individuals more willing to accept UGS and thus more likely to be the first occupants) across all cities prioritized air quality. Present results suggest that (perceived) air quality is a key building performance aspect for UGS that needs to be communicated to prospective occupants as this will improve their attitudes and views toward UGS.

Air pollution and the built environment can limit participation in physical activity and exacerbate non-communicable disease risk; however, the relationships between perceptions of air pollution, built environment, and health behaviours are not fully understood, particularly among children and youth in low and middle-income countries. Currently, there are no studies capturing how child and youth perceptions of air pollution and built environment are associated with physical activity in India, thus, this study investigated the association between perceived air pollution and built environment on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels of Indian children and youth. Online surveys captured MVPA, perception of air pollution as a problem, built environment factors, as well as relevant sociodemographic characteristics from parents and children aged 5-17 years in partnership with 41 schools across 28 urban and rural locations during the Coronavirus disease lockdowns in 2021. After adjusting for age, gender, and location, a significant association was found between the perception of air pollution as a problem and MVPA levels (beta =-18.365, p < 0.001). Similarly, the perception of a high crime rate was associated with lower MVPA levels (beta =-23.383, p = 0.002). Reporting the presence of zebra crossings, pedestrian signals, or attractive natural sightings were associated with higher MVPA levels; however, this association varied across sociodemographic groups.

Awareness about the potential health impacts of air pollution from industry can influence people's risk perception. This in turn can affect (self-reported) symptoms. Our aims were to investigate the associations of air pollution from heavy industry with health symptoms and to evaluate whether these associations are mediated by people's risk perception about local industry. Methods A cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted among children (2-18 years) and adults (19 years and above) living in the direct vicinity of an area with heavy industry. A dispersion model was used to characterize individual-level exposures to air pollution emitted from the industry in the area. Associations between PM2.5 and NOx with presence of chronic diseases (adults) and respiratory symptoms (adults and children) were investigated by logistic regression analysis. Risk perception was indirectly measured by worries about local industry (0-10 scale). Mediation analyses were performed to investigate the role of mediation by these worries. Results The response was 54% (2,627/4,877). In adults exposure to modelled PM2.5 from industry (per mu g/m(3)) was related with reported high blood pressure (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.13-2.15) and exposure to modelled NOx (per mu g/m(3)) was inversely related with cardiovascular diseases (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.98). In children higher PM2.5 and NOx concentrations (per mu g/m(3)) were related with wheezing (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.24-3.24 and OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.21 respectively) and dry cough (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.55-3.52 and OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.10-1.22 respectively). Parental worry about local industry was an important mediator in exposure-health relations in children (indirect effect between 19-28%). Conclusion Exposure from industry was associated with self-reported reported high blood pressure among adults and respiratory symptoms among their children.

China's air pollution has reached the hazardous level since 2000s. In consideration of the serious health and social problems, residential demand for clean air is increasing. This paper applies the Contingent Valuation method to estimate public's willingness to pay (WTP) for reducing air pollution in the urban area of China. Open-ended scenarios through face-to-face surveys are used to elicit public's WTP. The Two-Part model is employed for the estimation: the probit model is used to estimate the probability of respondents who have positive WTP values, and the interval regression model is employed to estimate the specific WTP level of those with nonzero WTP values. The results show that nearly 90% of the respondents are willing to pay for reducing air pollution, and the average amount of WTP per individual is 382.6RMB per year. Household income is found to be positively correlated with people's WTP, and those who trust the government are more willing to share the cost of reducing air pollution. This study recommends designing some effective mechanisms to tap the potentially available source of money for smog mitigation and improving the transparency of smog governance to enhance the government credibility as solutions to cope with smog crisis.

However, many studies have indicated that self-reported health status, such as disease severity and depressive symptoms, are associated with perceived air pollution rather than measured air pollution. The main goal of this study was to investigate social factors that may affect perceived local air quality using a multilevel analysis among a Korean population. We used the Seoul Citizens Health Indicator Survey (SCHIS III) and five air pollutants. The total study population was 16,041. We considered individual-level and community-level variables that may affect perceived air quality, such as the percentage of college-educated individuals aged >20 years, satisfaction with public transportation, and the percentage of individuals below the poverty line. Measured air quality showed a negative or neutral relationship with perceived air quality. We found that the degree of perceived air pollution was associated with younger age (20-34 years; OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.18-1.65), married and divorced/separated/widowed people, a higher level of education (>17 years; OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.30-2.15), and lower household income. Communities that were more economically deprived were associated with poor perceived air quality. Differences in individual and community characteristics affected perceived air quality. Perception is a key factor influencing the public acceptance of environmental policy. This study may help policymakers understand the social distribution of environmental awareness.

The aim of this study was to test a model that describes interrelations between air pollution (particles < 10 m, PM10), perceived pollution, health risk perception, health symptoms and diseases. A population-based questionnaire study was conducted among 1000 Estonian residents (sample was stratified by age, sex, and geographical location) about health risk perception and coping. The PM10 levels were modelled in 1 x 1 km grids using a Eulerian air quality dispersion model. Respondents were ascribed their annual mean PM10 exposure according to their home address. Path analysis was performed to test the validity of the model. The data refute the model proposing that exposure level significantly influences symptoms and disease. Instead, the perceived exposure influences symptoms and the effect of perceived exposure on disease is mediated by health risk perception. This relationship is more pronounced in large cities compared to smaller towns or rural areas. Perceived pollution and health risk perception, in particular in large cities, play important roles in understanding and predicting environmentally induced symptoms and diseases at relatively low levels of air pollution.",Perceived pollution; Epidemiology; Path analysis; Air pollution modelling; Questionnaire survey,,EXPOSURE; ANNOYANCE; INDEXES; STRESS; REGION,WOS

One way to lessen the health effects of air pollution is to change personal travel behaviour with the help of new information, communication and sensing technologies. Our social research tracked the experiences of participants, air quality and technology enthusiasts, based in London who financially contributed to participate in an early-stage technical trial of a new air pollution sensor and app providing individuals with air pollution information (specifically levels of NO2 and VOCs). This paper reports the results of a before and after survey (returning respondents n=22) and 12 in-depth interviews with individuals who took part in the beta test of the sensor and phone app. The survey results show that travel-related behaviours and attitudes relevant to air pollution did not change after using the technology. In contrast, expectations of technology performance and the extent it would influence behaviours were significantly lower after the trial than before. Further exploration during semi-structured interviews found that the participants, given their already high level of engagement with the topic, felt the capacity for immediate individual behaviour change was limited. As well as time and practical constraints, most people in this sample felt they were already doing what they could to avoid high levels of air pollution in their daily lives. Despite this, they had some recommendations to improve the app, such as the inclusion of real-time and historic maps, and the ability to make self and other comparisons. Overwhelmingly, people saw a broader role for the technology to engage the public with air pollution through raising awareness, and harnessing citizen science to collect diverse reliable data to inform policy and influence local policymakers to reduce air pollution levels.",,,PLANNED BEHAVIOR; CITIZEN SCIENCE; SELF-IDENTITY; CONSERVATION; MODELS; IMPACT; TOOL,WOS

A total of 244 subjects (65 males and 179 females) responded to questionnaires in a design studio operated with DOAS-CF at a warmer setpoint temperature of 27 °C and a computer lab operated with FCU at a setpoint temperature of 24 °C (which is common for the Tropics). Occupants under DOAS-CF at 27 °C felt more thermally comfortable and expressed higher thermal acceptability than those under FCU at 24 °C through their behavioral adjustment in choosing their sitting location based on their thermal and air movement preferences. With DOAS-CF, the cooling experienced by the nose has favorably inclined the olfactory sense towards PAQ; however, there is a small percentage who felt the PAQ was unacceptable as they were also thermally uncomfortably warm. Energy consumption of DOAS-CF was 27.7% lower than that of FCU due to warmer setpoint temperature. Despite creating a wide range of effective temperatures, DOAS-CF system can achieve better thermal comfort when occupants’ behavioral adaptation is empowered; it also achieves higher energy conservation by increasing setpoint temperature than the conventional mixing AC system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Air movement; Behavioral adjustment; Dedicated outdoor air system with ceiling fans; Field survey; Perceived air quality; Thermal comfort and acceptability,Air conditioning; Air quality; College buildings; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Felt; Felts; Surveys; Thermal comfort; Air movement preferences; Behavioral adaptation; Conventional air-conditioning systems; Dedicated outdoor air systems; Effective temperature; Perceived air quality; Set-point temperatures; Thermal acceptabilities; air conditioning; air quality; airflow; field survey; perception; temperature effect; ventilation; Behavioral research,,Scopus

This study aimed to reveal the potential impacts of haze pollution on the tourism industry. Based on a case study in Beijing using questionnaires for potential tourists, awareness of haze pollution, impacts of haze pollution on travel and attitudes toward the impacts were discussed. The results indicated that haze pollution has a considerable potential impact on travel, and there are distinct differences among travel elements and tourism market segments. Due to its impacts, haze pollution could be taken into account in tourists' decision-making processes, causing a portion of potential tourists to cancel tourism plans. As a result, tourist arrivals to similar destinations could decrease by a small margin, but the most significant impact could be on the temporal distribution of tourist arrivals, namely tourism seasonality, due to tourists' avoiding psychology.",Beijing; Haze pollution; Perception; Potential impact; Tourism seasonality,Beijing [China]; China; decision making; haze; perception; pollution effect; questionnaire survey; seasonality; temporal distribution; tourism market; tourist behavior; travel behavior,PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION; HEALTH; QUALITY,WOS

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the associations of exposure to traffic-related air pollutants (TRAPs) and noise at school on behavioral development of schoolchildren. METHODS: We evaluated children 7-11 years of age in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) during 2012-2013 within the BREATHE project. Indoor and outdoor concentrations of elemental carbon (EC), black carbon (BC), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were measured at schools in two separate 1-week campaigns. In one campaign we also measured noise levels inside classrooms. Parents filled out the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) to assess child behavioral development, while teachers completed the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder criteria of the DSM-IV (ADHD-DSM- IV) list to assess specific ADHD symptomatology. Negative binomial mixed-effects models were used to estimate associations between the exposures and behavioral development scores. RESULTS: Interquartile range (IQR) increases in indoor and outdoor EC, BC, and NO2 concentrations were positively associated with SDQ total difficulties scores (suggesting more frequent behavioral problems) in adjusted multivariate models, whereas noise was significantly associated with ADHD-DSM-IV scores. CONCLUSION: In our study population of 7-to 11-year-old children residing in Barcelona, exposure to TRAPs at school was associated with increased behavioral problems in schoolchildren.

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a cross-sectional survey with a model based on previous theories. Data from 2,000 adults were self-administered and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: PLS-SEM confirmed six hypotheses, revealing mass media's direct and mediating roles in promoting critical psychological perceptions for protective behavior. The empirical results indicate that neuroticism, agreeableness and openness traits reinforce adherence behavior by intensifying threat perception. Practical implications: This paper highlights significant implications for media campaign planners and provides more precise and comprehensive theoretical guidance.

The movement of goods in cities is a major contributor to local emissions caused by mobile sources. Trucks emit many pollutants (notably NOx and particulate matter) because they mostly use diesel and because there is a high proportion of old trucks and vans circulating in cities. As a result of this research, it seems that there are few policy innovations in freight issues in cities. Even more surprising is, in France, the low level of legal disputes over air quality standards attainment issues. Nonetheless, responding to public opinion's increasing concern over health issues and to European standards for urban air quality, some European cities have started to reserve access to city centres to new, 'clean' or 'fully loaded' trucks. By doing so, they have engaged in a more environmentally oriented urban freight strategy. The main conclusion of this article is that this new type of environmental regulation targeted on trucks is the best way available for cities wishing to improve their environment and air quality.

The findings show that, while China's cognitive image attributes were perceived positively, potential travellers expressed negative views about travel risks in China in general and about air quality in particular. Importantly, feelings towards the risk of air quality had a significant negative impact on destination image as well as intention to visit China. The research contributes to theory by highlighting the importance of considering affective risk perceptions in destination image studies.

Self-protective measures are available, but population uptake is variable. It is essential to understand human beliefs and behaviours related to air pollution in order to understand the lack of self-protection in communities. As a prelude to undertaking a comprehensive assessment of children's attitudes and beliefs on the health effects of TRAP exposure, we sought to develop and validate an appropriate instrument. Study design: This study used exploratory sequential mixed methods. Methods: This instrument, based on the constructs of the health belief model (HBM), aimed to determine factors predicting wearing a mask to protect against TRAP exposure. An initial literature-based questionnaire was modified using in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and a quantitative survey pilot. This study included 121 school students and nine professional experts in Vietnam. The questionnaire was tested for content validity, agreement, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency. Results: The concordance of questionnaire items between two repeated assessments ranged from 47.2% to 78.3%, intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.16 to 0.87 and Cronbach's internal reliability coefficient for the instrument was 0.60. Conclusion: The self-administered instrument, based on the HBM, is suitable to understand health attitudes and beliefs related to self-protective behaviours to reduce TRAP exposure.

The level of pollutants emitted in the city is variable, and it depends on the type and nature of the source and the manner of land development. For this reason, the purpose of the article is an attempt at a spatial (inner) diversification of a city in terms of air quality, using a study of perception and semantic differentials (SD). The research, which covered the period from June to November 2021, was performed in Kielce-the Polish Smart City-among local experts, people well acquainted with the city and knowledgeable about air quality and the impact of pollution on human health. The results allowed the demarcation of areas with the best and the worst parameters in terms of air quality within the city. Verification of the survey was carried out using the ADMS-Roads (Atmospheric Dispersion Modeling System) software for modeling pollution levels and GIS software, using data on road traffic. The verification allowed checking whether the respondents participating in the research accurately evaluated the city space. The modeling proved that within the two selected areas, the pollution level is similar, and it does not exceed the permitted values. This might indicate that in society there is still low awareness of air quality, particularly in terms of knowing the sources of pollutants and their impact on human health, and perception of areas with the best and the worst air quality was the result of an analysis of the manner of land development and its morphology.",air quality; surveys; GIS; pollution modeling; Smart City,,POLLUTION; POLLUTANTS; IMPACT; SCALE; SPACE; PM2.5,WOS

A single-bound dichotomous choice contingent valuation approach using the referendum format was used to estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) from a survey of 1,000 households. The study arrived at WTP estimates for the proposed program ranging from USD3.85 to USD5.77 per month. Income elasticity of WTP was estimated at 0.49. The study also investigated the impact of using secret ballots for eliciting WTP responses to minimize yea-saying behavior and reduce social desirability bias.",Willingness to pay; air quality; jeepney; secret ballot,,CONTINGENT VALUATION; HYPOTHETICAL BIAS; MECHANISMS; OPTIONS; TESTS; GOODS,WOS

Estimated annual median and mean WTP values are $95 and $191, respectively, per person per year for assurance that ozone levels would not become ''unhealthful'' on any day. The survey informed respondents that in the prior year the local community experienced 14 days on which ozone levels exceeded federal standards. The study makes the strong assumptions that respondents believed they were ''buying'' 14 more healthy days and that WTP per day ''bought'' is constant. Given these assumptions, one can scale this WTP response to represent annual medians and means of approximately $7 and $14 per person per day, respectively. An econometric procedure for generalizing the community's annual WTP to avoid the 14 unhealthful days yields estimates ranging from $3.21 and $5.36 per person per healthy day, or between $12.4 and $20.6 million per year. The unit day estimates are comparable to CV and household production function estimates of WTP in the Los Angeles basin, suggesting their usefulness for benefits transfer.",,,,WOS

Health Beliefs and Protective Behaviors against Particulate Matter,"Kim, J; Kim, Y",2021,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,18.0,6,"Air pollution has become a critically important contemporary issue, exposing people to various health risks worldwide. Air pollution problems cannot be resolved in the short-term; therefore, citizens in regions with low air quality are encouraged to take protective actions such as wearing masks to filter particulate matter. However, compliance with such recommendations is limited. To enhance the effectiveness of health promotion in this regard, this study applied the health belief model to examine the factors that affect mask-wearing behaviors. It also investigates the factors that influence particulate matter-related health beliefs and protective behaviors. A cross-sectional survey with 200 Korean citizens was conducted. The results revealed associations between masking behaviors and both perceived benefits of and perceived physical barriers to wearing masks. In addition, sex, education, income, and having heard of different particulate matter-related health consequences were found to predict mask-wearing. This study demonstrates the utility of the health belief model in the context of air pollution and has practical implications for health promotion practitioners.",particulate matter; health belief model; perceived susceptibility; perceived severity; perceived benefits; perceived barriers; mask-wearing; health promotion; health communication,,VACCINE UPTAKE; MODEL; COMMUNICATION; METAANALYSIS; MOTIVATION,WOS

A critical review of the literature,Chatzidiakou L.; Mumovic D.; Summerfield A.J.,2012,,4.0,4,"The increasing interest in indoor environmental quality of educational buildings has been underpinned by the rising incidence of asthma and respiratory disease among children, who spend a substantial amount of their lives on the school premises. The susceptibility of children to respiratory disease compared with adults has led to the formulation of regulatory frameworks for the school environment, which specifies maximum CO 2 concentrations and minimum airflow rates. This article reviews the evidence that school buildings provide a healthy and satisfactory indoor environment for the occupants. It summarized air pollution levels reported from indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring surveys and evidence linking school exposure with health responses from the occupants. In addition, environmental and behavioural factors affecting pollution levels in school buildings were examined. The analysis has highlighted the degraded IAQ in some schools that often exceed WHO guidelines, while health impacts of school exposure were reported for concentrations below current guidelines. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",allergens; bacteria; carbon dioxide (CO <sub>2</sub>); fungi; health impacts; nitrogen dioxide (NO <sub>2</sub>); ozone (O <sub>3</sub>); particulate matter (PM); schools; ventilation rates; volatile organic compounds (VOCs),Fungi; Bacteria; Fungi; Health; Indoor air pollution; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Pulmonary diseases; School buildings; Volatile organic compounds; allergens; Health impact; Nitrogen dioxides; Particulate Matter; schools; Ventilation rate; adult; air quality; allergy; asthma; atmospheric pollution; bacterium; carbon dioxide; child health; critical analysis; disease incidence; fungus; guideline; health impact; indoor air; literature review; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; pollution exposure; student; ventilation; volatile organic compound; World Health Organization; Carbon dioxide,,Scopus

We draw on individual-level data from two Eurobarometer surveys together with qualitative data from a series of original elite interviews and the analysis of related policy documents, and we find little evidence that activism was a driver of variations in local popular awareness of air pollution, but support for the supposition that activism played a major role in shaping policy change at local level.",Air pollution; Poland; activism; policy change,Poland [Central Europe]; atmospheric pollution; civil society; policy reform; politics; social movement,URBAN SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; CLIMATE; DIFFERENCE; ANNOYANCE; HEALTH,WOS

Four Cases on Surveillance, Traffic Congestion, Road Safety, and Air Pollution","Bump, JB; Reddiar, SK; Soucat, A",2019,HEALTH SYSTEMS & REFORM,5.0,4,"Common goods such as air, water, climate, and other resources shared by all humanity are under increasing pressure from growing population and advancing globalization of the world economy. Safeguarding these resources is generally considered a government responsibility, as common goods are vulnerable to market failure. However, governments do not always fulfill this role, and face many challenges in doing so. This observation-that governments only sometimes address common goods problems-informs the central question of this paper: when do governments act in support of common goods? We structure our inquiry using a framework derived from three theories of agenda setting, emphasizing problem perception, the role of actors and collective action patterns, strategies and policies, and catalyzing circumstances. We used a poll of experts to identify important common goods for health: disease surveillance, environmental protection, and accountability. We then chose four historical cases for analysis: the establishment of the Epidemic Intelligence Service in the US, transport planning in London, road safety in Argentina, and air quality control in urban India. Our analysis of the collective evidence of these cases suggests that decisions to advance government action on common goods require a concisely articulated problem, a well-defined strategy for addressing the problem, and leadership backed by at least a few important groups willing to cooperate. Our cases reveal a variety of collective action patterns, suggesting that there are many routes to success. We consider that the timing of an intervention in support of common goods depends on favorable circumstances, which can include a catalyzing event but does not necessarily require one.",collective action; common goods; global health history; government failure; public health,,DISEASE; TIME; EPIDEMIC; FAILURE,WOS

Research indicates Metro Manila's annual average PM2.5 concentration is among the highest globally, often exceeding US EPA and the country’s standards. The high levels of air pollutants in the ambient air of Metro Manila and the related illnesses have led to the need to prepare for the improvement of air quality. The public’s knowledge and awareness of environmental issues are crucial for their participation in reducing and mitigating air pollution. Thus, this study examined the level of awareness, perception, and attitude of residents in Metro Manila towards air quality and its health effects. To meet the objective of this study, a total of 57 questions were applied to a questionnaire given to 593 respondents from Metro Manila. In terms of the level of awareness of the respondents, 54.1%, 69.6%, and 54.4% of the respondents are unaware of the air quality laws, standards, and policies governing emissions from vehicles and other businesses, respectively. Likewise, the majority of the respondents are not aware of the air quality programs of the government, except the anti-smoke belching. Respondents perceive that air pollution ranges from extensive to very extensive at 37.8% and 50.8%, respectively. Metro Manila residents express concern over air quality and a positive attitude to contribute to developing behaviors that are kind toward the environment. However, the lack of information on air quality status, programs, and laws, particularly in Metro Manila may hinder individual-related behavioral change to reduce air pollution in the Philippines. Hence, the study recommends that all leading governmental agencies that manage air quality should intensify their information drives about current trends and effects of air pollution and incorporate mitigating measures to reduce air pollution in educational efforts to encourage individuals to act. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Air pollution; Air quality; Awareness; Knowledge on air pollution; Metro Manila; Perception of air pollution,,,Scopus

Does this effectiveness vary depending on whether individuals are already thinking about changing? This paper has two main objectives: (1) to explore how individuals at different stages of the behavioural change process perceive air pollution, focussing on the perceived psychological distance of its environmental risks (Study 1); and (2) to test whether the effects of presenting the risks of air pollution in a narrative vs. statistical format on pro-environmental intentions vary depending on the individuals' stage of behavioural change (Study 2). Study 1 (N = 263) is based on a survey measuring individuals' perceived psychological distance of the environmental risks of air pollution, and the perceived effectiveness of different pro-environmental behaviours. Results suggest that perceived distance and perceived effectiveness vary across different stages of behavioural change. Study 2 (N = 258) presents a 2(Format: narrative vs. statistical) x 3(Stages of change) protocol, testing the effectiveness of a narrative format depending on individuals' stage of behavioural change. Results suggest that proximising a threat through a narrative format of communication is more effective especially for individuals in the pre-action stage of change.

We argue that severe air pollution conveys new information to the Chinese people, enhancing their understanding of the deficiencies in authoritarian governance and reducing the support of environmentally-aware individuals for the government. In other words, the impact of environmental awareness on political trust depends on the gravity of air pollution. When people perceive air pollution as severe, it can directly cause those who are environmentally conscious to reduce their trust in the government. On the other hand, the impact of new information regarding severe air pollution on political trust also relies on the level of individuals' environmental awareness. When environmental awareness is low, individuals may prioritize economic growth. However, when environmental awareness is high, an increase in air pollution will elicit negative sentiments towards the government.",Air pollution; Environmental awareness; Political trust; Asian barometer survey,,CORRUPTION; SUPPORT; SATISFACTION; GOVERNMENT; LEGITIMACY; DEMOCRACY; IMPACT,WOS

The different effects of demographic variables on the dimensions of smog-induced health risk perception were investigated through 715 questionnaires distributed to skilled workers living in areas polluted by smog. The results showed that smog-induced health risk perception is a two-dimensional concept. We found that 86.3% of skilled workers perceived that physical health risk level was higher than mental health risk level. One-third of the population in most groups perceived higher degree of physical health risk than that of mental health risk, but the difference between physical and mental health risk for them was small. Moreover, skilled workers with a high level of smog-induced health risk perception were distributed mainly in groups of long employment duration, older skilled workers and skilled workers living in areas severely polluted by smog. Based on our results, we propose practical suggestions to help government, enterprises and skilled workers improve physical and mental health of skilled workers.",skilled workers; smog-induced health risk perception; smog pollution area of China; demographic variables,,AIR-POLLUTION; ENVIRONMENTAL RISK; PERCEPTION; EXPOSURE; BEHAVIOR; PERFORMANCE; MIGRATION; DISEASE; HAZE; FOOT,WOS

This causes a serious problem of emitting air pollutants such as particulate matters, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides. Thus, the South Korean government is seeking to substitute a part of coal-fired generation with natural gas (NG)-based combined heat and power (CHP) generation for the purpose of mitigating air pollutants emissions. This article tries to assess the public willingness to pay (WTP) for the substitution adopting contingent valuation (CV). The data on the additional WTP for consuming 1 kWh of electricity produced from NG-based CHP generation over coal-fired generation were gathered from a CV survey of 1000 interviewees. The mean additional WTP estimate for the substitution is obtained as KRW 28.08 (USD 0.025) per kWh of electricity use. This is equivalent to 25.9% of the average price of electricity, KRW 108.50 (USD 0.098) per kWh in 2017. It is obvious that the South Korean public has a significant WTP for substituting coal with NG in electricity generation to mitigate air pollutants emissions.

Using a U.S. national YouGov sample (n = 1000), we examined how discussing emissions in terms of climate change or air pollution, and in terms of health or environmental impacts, influenced individuals with different partisan affiliations. The analysis utilized a moderated-mediation model, with belief in negative impacts of power plant emissions as the mediator, support for government action as the dependent variable, and political party as a moderator of the link from the message frame to belief. This analysis revealed that using a climate change frame relative to an air pollution frame lowered policy support both directly and indirectly via belief in negative impacts, with the strongest indirect effect observed for Republicans. There were no effects of discussing environmental versus health impacts. The results suggest that communicators may be more successful in increasing support for mitigating carbon pollution from power plants by focusing on non-climate change oriented risks that the pollution poses, rather than linking the pollution to climate change.",Climate change; Framing; Public opinion; Motivated reasoning,,PUBLIC-OPINION; POLARIZATION; POLICY; MITIGATION; SCIENCE; COAL; COMMUNICATION; ENGAGEMENT; REPUBLICAN; MOVEMENTS,WOS

Promoting public participation in reducing PM2.5, especially among young people, is one effective manner in which to control PM2.5 emissions. The present study explores the determinants that influence young people's behavioural intentions towards reducing PM2.5 using an extended version of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), which incorporates personal moral norms. Additionally, this paper evaluates and compares the direct and indirect relationships between subjective norms and PM2.5 reduction intentions. This study was tested empirically using survey data collected from 425 respondents in China. The results revealed that young people's attitude towards reducing PM2.5, the subjective norm, was that behavioural control and personal moral norms significantly affect PM2.5 reduction intentions.
