524;10.3390/ijerph15040679;Association between Four-Level Categorisation of Indoor Exposure and Perceived Indoor Air Quality;Finland;;"Tähtinen, K; Lappalainen, S; Karvala, K; Remes, J; Salonen, H";2018;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH;15;4;The aim of this study was to develop and test a tool for assessing urgency of indoor air quality (IAQ) measures. The condition of the 27 buildings were investigated and results were categorized. Statistical test studied the differences between the categories and the employees' complaints about their work environment. To study the employees' experiences of the work premises, a validated indoor air (IA) questionnaire was used. This study reveals a multifaceted problem: many factors affecting IAQ may also affect perceived IAQ, making it difficult to separate the impurity sources and ventilation system deficiencies affecting to employee experiences. An examination of the relationship between the categories and perceived IAQ revealed an association between the mould odour perceived by employees and mould detected by the researcher. A weak link was also found between the assessed categories and environmental complaints. However, we cannot make far-reaching conclusions regarding the assessed probability of abnormal IA exposure in the building on the basis of employee experiences. According to the results, categorising tool can partly support the assessment of the urgency for repairs when several factors that affect IAQ are taken into account.;"indoor air; impurity sources; categorisation; building investigation; repair urgency; indoor air questionnaire";"Adult; Air Conditioning; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Finland; Hospitals; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; Workplace; concrete; air quality; indoor air; air quality; Article; building; dust; employee; environmental exposure; human; indoor air pollution; moisture; mould; probability; questionnaire; room temperature; room ventilation; work environment; adult; air conditioning; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; female; Finland; hospital; indoor air pollution; male; middle aged; procedures; risk assessment; standards; statistics and numerical data; workplace";"SICK-BUILDING SYNDROME; ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY; REPORTED SYMPTOMS; SCHOOL BUILDINGS; OFFICE BUILDINGS; MOISTURE DAMAGE; HEALTH-HAZARDS; MOLD; RISK; PERFORMANCE";WOS

However, the associations between anxiety behavior and toxicity caused by PM10 have rarely been reported so far. To investigate the changes of behavior after PM10 exposure and to identify the potential mechanisms of toxicity, PM10 samples (with doses of 15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) were intratracheally instilled into rats to simulate inhalation of polluted air by the lungs. After instillation for eight weeks, anxiety-like behavior was evaluated, levels of oxidative stress and morphological changes of hippocampus were measured. The behavioral results indicated that PM10 exposure induced obvious anxiety-like behavior in the open field and elevated plus maze tests. Both PM10 concentrations tested could increase whole blood viscosity and trigger hippocampal neuronal damage and oxidative stress by increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and malondialdehyde levels, and decreasing the expressions of antioxidant-related proteins (e.g., nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), SOD1 and heme oxygenase 1). Furthermore, through collecting and analyzing questionnaires, the data showed that the participants experienced obvious anxiety-related emotions and negative somatic responses under heavily polluted environments, especially PM10 being the main pollutant. These results show that PM10 exposure induces anxiety-like behavior, which may be related to suppressing the Nrf2/Keap1-SOD1 pathway.;"Anxiety-like behavior; Oxidative stress; Nrf2; Hippocampus";"Animals; Anxiety; Hippocampus; Humans; Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Oxidative Stress; Rats; Superoxide Dismutase-1; heme oxygenase 1; malonaldehyde; superoxide dismutase; transcription factor Nrf2; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; kelch like ECH associated protein 1; transcription factor Nrf2; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anxiety disorder; anxiety like behavior; Article; blood viscosity; controlled study; elevated plus maze test; hippocampus; human; long term exposure; male; morphology; nerve cell lesion; nonhuman; oxidative stress; PM10 exposure; protein expression; rat; toxicity; animal; anxiety; genetics; hippocampus; metabolism";"AIRBORNE PARTICULATE MATTER; AIR-POLLUTION; SIGNALING PATHWAY; IMMUNE-RESPONSE; PM2.5; HEALTH; NEUROINFLAMMATION; EXPRESSION; DEPRESSION; MORTALITY";WOS

A longitudinal analysis of opinions about air pollution and electric vehicles;United States;;"Gould, J; Golob, TF";1998;TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT;3;3;Many current initiatives to develop the electric vehicle depend upon public perception that electric vehicles (EVs) are good for the environment. This study investigates how people acquire information about the environment and EVs, and whether their opinions about environmental efficacy change over time and experience levels. These issues are explored across two data sets. The first data set is a panel survey of California households (n = 1718) and environmental opinions are tracked over two waves of survey. A decline in the environmental ethos is associated with several factors, including interpersonal communications and exposure to more specialized media. A sample of households from the panel study were subsequently chosen, among others, to participate in a 2-week long trial of EVs (n = 69). Opinions about environmental efficacy are studied as users gain first hand knowledge of an EV. Opinions about the environmental efficacy of the EV show improvement, but trial users become less likely to cite the environmental benefit as a reason for choosing the technology, and they do not change their opinions about providing policy incentives.

Mortality and respiratory diseases caused by air pollution are believed to be endemic in major cities of these countries. Regulations and standards are the first requirement for reducing emissions from both fixed and mobile sources. This paper emphasizes monitoring problems such as vehicle registration systems, inspection and maintenance (I/M) systems and fuel quality monitoring systems for vehicles in use. Monitoring problems in developing countries share similar characteristics such as a weakness in government initiatives and inadequate operation of government agencies, which results from a lack of human resources and availability of adequate facilities. Finally, this paper proposes a method to assure air quality improvements under the different shares of emission regulations in these Asian countries and introduces an example of an evaluation method based on a policy survey to improve air quality. © 2010 by the authors.;"Air pollution; Asia; Environment and development; Regulatory policies; Transportation";"Air pollution; Developing countries; Economics; Monitoring; Transportation; Transportation personnel; Vehicles; Air quality improvement; Asia; Environment and development; Government initiatives; Inadequate operation; Inspection and maintenance; Regulatory policies; Vehicle registration; Air quality";;Scopus

Interventions to avoid PM exposure are important but evidence-based guidance is lacking. This study aims to assess the impact of PM on lung function, quality of life and exacerbations in patients with COPD using a panel design study; it will also provide evidence for interventional measures to reduce harm from PM exposure. Methods and analysis A prospective panel study of patients with COPD aged >= 40 years will be conducted. Patients will be required to have a forced expiratory volume in one second <80% of the predicted value at enrolment. A total of 120 patients from three different regions will be enrolled, 60 from the metropolitan area, 30 from an industrialised area and 30 from a clean rural area. Clinical outcomes will be assessed through COPD assessment test scores, the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for patients with COPD and pulmonary function testing. Indoor and outdoor PM in the patients' environments will be measured using gravimetric and light scattering platforms. To estimate the individual dose of PM exposure, a time-activity diary, Geographic Information System and land use regression model will be combined in every season for 1 year. The correlation between PM exposure and the health status of patients with COPD will be evaluated. In addition, 40 patients with the lowest score of life behaviour score to reduce environmental PM exposure will be randomised to a control or intervention group, who will receive in-depth education on risk-reducing behaviours.

The aim of this study was to investigate an extended parallel process model (EPPM)-based mobile phone text message intervention for improving protective behaviors against air pollution among pregnant women. In this randomized controlled trial (IRCT2016102810804N8), 130 pregnant women were randomly assigned into either experimental or control groups. A valid and reliable questionnaire was used to collect data. Experimental group received mobile phone intervention on a daily basis for 2 months. Control group received usual care, only. Data were analyzed using SPSS 15 applying t test, chi-square, and Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U test. Although before intervention, there were no significant differences between different structures of EPPM (P > 0.05), after intervention, there were statistically significant differences between perceived severity, response efficacy, self-efficacy, and protective behaviors between two groups (P < 0.05). Implementing EPPM based-mobile phone intervention could promote protective behaviors against air pollution among pregnant women. The present study might be used as a framework for evidence-based health promotion regarding air pollution risk communication and self-care behaviors.

Surveys conducted during this period have yielded lessons for designing better intervention strategies for the residential sector, taking into account the systematic morphological and economic limitations of the buildings concerned. These considerations should inform the development of policies and strategies for improving environmental quality compatible with lower residential energy consumption and higher quality of life. This study explores the effect of occupant behaviour on home ventilation and the perception of the impact of indoor air quality on user health before and during lockdown. The method deployed consisted in monitoring environmental variables and conducting user surveys before and after restrictions came into force. The findings showed that prior to lockdown, occupants were unaware of or paid little heed to changes in indoor air quality, failed to perceive stuffiness, and, as a rule, reported symptoms or discomfort only at night during the summer months. During lockdown, however, users came to attach greater importance to air quality, and a greater sensitivity to odours and a heightened awareness of CO2 concentration prompted them to ventilate their homes more frequently. In the spring of 2020, occupants also indicated a wider spectrum of indisposition, in particular in connection with sleep patterns.;"Airtightness; Indoor air quality; Occupants' perception; Low-income housing; Ventilation behaviour; Health effects; COVID-19; Lockdown";"air quality; COVID-19; environmental quality; housing; indoor air; residential energy; sleep; summer; ventilation";"AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION; THERMAL COMFORT; CARBON-DIOXIDE; SLEEP QUALITY; AIRTIGHTNESS; PRODUCTIVITY; ENVIRONMENT; POLLUTION; IMPACTS; COOKING";WOS

The present study attempts to clarify physicians’ moral responsibility in this regard and the roles they can play to decrease environmental problems. It also evaluates their attitudes towards and performance of these roles. The clarification of this issue paves the way for interventions through effective education or policy-making, as well as directing useful research. Materials and methods: A questionnaire was developed based on the results of qualitive study. The questionnaire assessed physicians’ awareness, attitude, and performance with regard to their environmental moral responsibilities. Results: Physicians with longer work experience had better performance. Those who worked in offices or at universities had also better performances compared to those working in hospitals. Physicians with more awareness had better performance, especially those who had acquired this awareness through books and educational workshops. The source of information was an effective factor on the gap between physicians’ attitude and performance scores those who had acquired information from books had the narrowest gap and those who had received information from social networks had the widest gap between attitude and performance scores. Conclusion: The health system and the environment and its problems are intertwined and greatly influence each other. Thus this interrelation and the necessity of being concerned and having moral sensitivity were explained. © 2021 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

Various investigations regarding particle reduction in urban green spaces have been conducted; however, specific guidelines to establish empirical data for green spaces and to inform related policies are still lacking. Thus, this study aims to categorize experts' perceptions of green spaces through Q-methodology and to identify ways to form a consensus, establish policies in the design and construction process, ultimately aiming to enhance particle reduction effects in urban green spaces. As a result, experts' perceptions were classified into three categories: 'active support,' 'skeptical,' and 'passive support' groups. Experts' opinions on the particle reduction effects of urban green areas are overarchingly agreed upon; however, the priorities involved and methods used in augmenting green space integration require further analysis and mediation. Additionally, further empirical evidence should be accumulated on the particulate matter reduction effects of urban green areas, including the quantification of particle concentration reduction in urban green spaces and considerations for policy establishment in design and construction. © 2019 by the authors.";"Air pollution; Air pollution policy; Particulate matter; Q-method; Urban forest";"air quality; atmospheric pollution; greenspace; numerical method; open space; particulate matter; perception; pollution policy; urban forestry; urban policy";;Scopus
53;10.1007/s11625-021-01038-2;How do we effectively communicate air pollution to change public attitudes and behaviours? A review;NA;reviewNA;"Riley, R; de Preux, L; Capella, P; Mejia, C; Kajikawa, Y; de Nazelle, A";2021;SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE;16;6;Solutions that engage the public are needed to tackle air pollution. Technological approaches are insufficient to bring urban air quality to recommended target levels, and miss out on opportunities to promote health more holistically through behavioural solutions, such as active travel. Behaviour change is not straightforward, however, and is more likely to be achieved when communication campaigns are based on established theory and evidence-based practices. We systematically reviewed the academic literature on air pollution communication campaigns aimed at influencing air pollution-related behaviour. Based on these findings, we developed an evidence-based framework for stimulating behaviour change through engagement. Across the 37 studies selected for analyses, we identified 28 different behaviours assessed using a variety of designs including natural and research-manipulated experiments, cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys and focus groups. While avoidance behaviour (e.g. reducing outdoor activity) followed by contributing behaviours (e.g. reducing idling) were by far the most commonly studied, supporting behaviour (e.g. civil engagement) shows promising results, with the added benefit that supporting local and national policies may eventually lead to the removal of social and physical barriers that prevent wider behavioural changes. Providing a range of actionable information will reduce disengagement due to feelings of powerlessness. Targeted localized information will appear more immediate and engaging, and positive framing will prevent cognitive dissonance whereby people rationalize their behaviour to avoid living with feelings of unease. Communicating the co-benefits of action may persuade individuals with different drivers but as an effective solution, it remains to be explored. Generally, finding ways to connect with people's emotions, including activating social norms and identities and creating a sense of collective responsibility, provide promising yet under-explored directions. Smartphones provide unique opportunities that enable flexible and targeted engagement, but care must be taken to avoid transferring responsibility for action from national and local authorities onto individuals. Multidisciplinary teams involving artists, members of the public, community and pressure groups, policy makers, researchers, and businesses, are needed to co-create the stories and tools that can lead to effective action to tackle air pollution through behavioural solutions.;"Air quality; Communication; Engagement; Campaign; Information role";;"HEALTH BELIEF MODEL; METROPOLITAN-AREA; QUALITY WARNINGS; SOCIAL NORMS; INFORMATION; ALERTS; IMPACT; CONSERVATION; SCIENCE; OZONE";WOS

While scientific interest in the problem continues to grow, efforts to measure indoor pollution concentrations, define exposure levels, and estimate health risks remain in their infancy. Within this arena, policymakers must deal with the question of how best to protect public health and safety in the face of incomplete and often contradictory information. In the past, official response to environmental pollution has traditionally taken the form of ""control by regulation."" However, creation of a regulatory framework for indoor air quality poses special policy issues that suggest the need to explore alternative modes of intervention. Ambient outdoor air is a public good, in the sense that enjoyment by one individual in no way detracts from use or enjoyment by others. Indoor air, on the other hand, is not a public good, especially in private residences. Costs and benefits of maintaining adequate indoor air quality are internalized within households, suggesting the possibility of a private demand for clean indoor air. Promulgation of indoor air quality standards and other regulations must confront the fact that individuals are already making decisions about their own air quality. Regulations might or might not improve these decisions. Development of effective and reasonable policy requires an appreciation of the scope for private action and consideration of the likelihood that public intervention will foster improved private choices. Among the logical and relatively inexpensive modes of intervention are public information programs, development of simple warning devices, and product testing and labeling. © 1982.";;"BUILDINGS; ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING - Public Policy; ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION; air quality control; housing; human; indoor air pollution; prevention; public opinion; therapy; REGULATIONS; AIR POLLUTION";;Scopus

Meanwhile, the ambient air pollution via particulate matter in such areas is closely related to the physical and mental health of the elderly visitors who suffer long-term exposure. This study is initiated to build a technological path between haze exposure and the elderly based on the positive and negative relationship between greenspace exposure and haze exposure under the background of the national strategy of healthy aging. In addition, the structured questionnaire interviews and the measured evidence-based experiments were conducted to collect data including physical environment data, crowd activity data, haze cognition data and basic population information. Combined with various statistical analyses including correlation analysis and mediating factor analysis, the impacts of haze in urban greenspaces on the decisions of the elderly to go out to visit such spaces as well as their physical and mental health were explored. A total of 138 crowd activity data and climate data were recorded, and 200 valid questionnaires were obtained. The results showed that the physical exercise and the social contact were two main reasons for the elderly to the greenspaces, and the typical activities of the elderly varied with the difference of physical environment using correlation and mediating effect analysis. Moreover, the air quality of six research sites reached or even be above moderate pollution (PM2.5 ≥115μg/ m3) during more than 70% of the survey period, suggesting that the air quality was worrying and exposed elderly visitors to serious health risks. According to questionnaire, the cognitive limitations on the potential hazards of haze were commonly existed in the elderly due to insufficient understanding of haze, vague perception and psychological neglect. In addition, the multiple and complex internal driving forces led to the decision-making of the elderly people to go to the greenspaces more perceptual than rational. Overall, there is no prominent correlation between PM2.5 concentration and crowd activities, showing that haze has little impact on the travel decision of the elderly since their insensitivity to haze pollution. There exists a gap between the cognitive decision of the elderly and the actual potential health hazards of haze. The results highlight the urgency of measures to promote healthy aging, and the importance of actively promoting the optimization of elderly-oriented landscape, which has certain reference value for the current human settlement environment construction. © 2022 Science Press.

The state should be able to satisfy this demand and this makes the present research truly vital. It concentrates on correlating expert and non-expert opinions expressed when perceiving risk quantification. Our goal was to answer two following questions: 1) How does an average unprofessional person quantify a probability and severity when he or she hears certain verbal expressions that denominate them? 2) How can we possibly identify the assessment of health risks associated with environmental pollution factors given by the population in general or specific social groups? To find answers to these questions, we applied quantitative methods for data collection and analysis. The first stage involved collecting data on subjective correlation of a verbal probability scale with its numeric expression among people living in industrial cities. The second stage focused on testing the methodology for studying assessments of health risks associated with ambient air pollution given by the population/social groups. This methodology relied on the results obtained at the previous stage. We established that only 70 % of people actually correlated words with figures. We determined that experts tended to rate probabilities approximately by 10 % higher than “average people” did when it came down to such words as “Virtually certain” and “Very likely”. Such words as “Likely”, “Similarly likely” and “Unlikely” were also rated differently but with a smaller gap between the opinions. The study also provides a method for determining the public assessment of health risks associated with ambient air pollution.

Indoor air questionnaires are useful for collecting information about the occupants' experiences and perceptions of the indoor air and for evaluating the results of the measures taken. A common way to implement health questionnaires is to ask the respondents to describe symptoms at certain time points, such as weeks or months. The aim of our study was to develop a short and easy online questionnaire to assess symptoms and perceived IAQ. We also aimed to test the usability of the questionnaire in school buildings and assess the differences between the online measurement data (CO2, T, and RH) and the IAQ complaints and symptoms reported by the pupils. A total of 105 teachers and 1268 pupils in 36 classrooms at six schools answered the questionnaires over a two-week period. The participants completed the questionnaire always after the lesson in the studied classroom. We received 719 answers from the teachers and 6322 answers from the pupils. The results demonstrated that the teachers reported more IAQ problems and symptoms than the pupils did. Differences between classrooms were observed in both the IAQ problem and reference schools. The most common significant differences (p-value > 0.05) between the classrooms were among humidity, too cold air, and stuffy air, and among symptoms, dry/sore throat, tiredness, headache, and skin symptoms. Maximum values of CO2 measurements and the highest prevalence of stuffy air were relatively consistent. The testing process demonstrated that such a questionnaire was suitable for adults and children aged at least 12 years. The results of our study suggest that a quick and easy online questionnaire that is completed within a short period may be useful for gathering valuable knowledge about perceived IAQ. It could be used in combination with other indoor environment investigations to produce detailed results and restorative measures.;"indoor air; health questionnaire; symptoms; pupils; teachers";"Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Health; Indoor air pollution; Teaching; Indoor air; Indoor air quality; Indoor environment; On-line measurement data; Online questionnaire; Pupils; Symptoms; Teachers; air quality; health survey; indoor air; questionnaire survey; student; symptom; Surveys";"RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; ELEMENTARY-SCHOOLS; HEALTH SYMPTOMS; VENTILATION RATES; MOISTURE DAMAGE; CHILDREN; ASTHMA; DAMPNESS; ASSOCIATIONS; PERFORMANCE";WOS

Addressing IAQ not only means ensuring that contaminants are below harmful concentration but also that people exposed are satisfied. However, current standards often lack clear metrics and thresholds dedicated to Perceived Air Quality (PAQ). Therefore, it is important to examine whether there is a prevalent method in the literature that could lead towards standardization. This review study constitutes the first comprehensive critical exploration of the subject. Adopting the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses) guidelines, the objective is to synthesize and compare diverse methods (subjective vs instrumental evaluations; object of judgment; component of perception; rating scales) for assessing PAQ in office buildings, based on insights from 93 field and laboratory studies. Results show that the assessment of PAQ predominantly relies on questionnaires (90 %), with a very smaller percentage using alternative methods such as olfactory indices, diaries, interviews, sensory testing, and text mining techniques. Workers' satisfaction is the most commonly evaluated aspect in PAQ questionnaires, often measured on a 7-point Likert scale. Odours are typically characterized in terms of intensity by utilizing a continuous 6-point unidirectional scale. Olfactory stimuli are usually considered with a negative connotation, being the absence of odour the target of IAQ design. The present study proposes a future research agenda that introduces the importance of a perceptual approach to evaluate the indoor olfactory environments (or smellscapes), aiming to create working spaces that are not only odour-neutral but also olfactorily pleasant.";"Indoor environmental quality; Odour; Office buildings; Perceived air quality; Smellscape";"Air quality; Indoor air pollution; Odors; 'current; Air quality assessment; Diverse methods; Indoor air quality; Indoor environmental quality; Meta-analysis; Perceived air quality; Smellscape; Systematic Review; Well being; air quality; building; environmental assessment; environmental quality; indoor air; literature review; odor; Office buildings";"LEED-CERTIFIED BUILDINGS; ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY; OCCUPANT SATISFACTION; SBS SYMPTOMS; DISPLACEMENT VENTILATION; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; USER SATISFACTION; WORK PERFORMANCE; COMFORT; IMPACT";WOS

Interdisciplinary research of the indoor environment (technical and medical fields) was based on the simultaneous measurement of the thermal environment parameters, as well on as on surveying employees during their normal working activities. The survey sought to determine the health status and health problems of those surveyed in the 6 months prior to the study, as well as the current state of health and current subjective evaluation of the thermal environment and air quality. Deviations between the measured values evaluated by predicted mean vote (PMV) - predicted percent of dissatisfied (PPD) model (PMV-PDD) and the subjective evaluations of thermal environment of those surveyed were found. The subjectively stated reasons for the health problems of employees gave precedence to natural, as opposed to mechanical, ventilation, which is confirmed by the average absence from work for health reasons. An index of health was defined and analyzed for the people within a building. Significant correlations between indoor air parameters and the way people felt were found.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate possible associations between ventilation system type and occupant perception of indoor air quality. Staff (n = 403) from 12 schools completed a self-administered questionnaire. Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, air exchange rates, and particle counts were also measured for each school. Schools with unit ventilator (UV) systems had the lowest mean CO2 level at 637 ppm, followed by the variable air volume (VAV) systems with 664 ppm, and constant volume (CV) systems with a mean of 703 ppm. Schools with UV systems had the lowest mean air exchange rate at 2.67 air changes per hour (ACH), followed by the VAV system type at 2.80 ACH and the CV system type at 4.61 ACH. Indoor versus outdoor particle ratios were calculated for each ventilation system type. Particles with aerodynamic diameters ranging from 0.1-1.0 μm had a geometric mean ratio ranging from 0.38 to 0.68; particles with aerodynamic diameters ranging from 1-3 μm had ratios ranging from 1.39 to 5.47, and particles with aerodynamic diameters greater than 3 μm had ratios ranging from 3.20 to 14.76. Schools using VAV systems had a significantly lower prevalence of red and watery eyes while schools with UV systems had an elevated prevalence of nasal congestion, sore throat, headache, and dustiness complaints. This increased prevalence of complaints in buildings with UV systems may be due to the increased particulate levels. © 2001 Applied Industrial Hygiene.";"Air Exchange Rates; Indoor Air Quality; Particle Counts; Questionnaire; Schools; Ventilation System Types";"Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; Colorado; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Male; Perception; Questionnaires; Schools; Ventilation; carbon dioxide; air conditioning; air pollutant; air quality; ambient air; article; atmospheric dispersion; carbon dioxide measurement; dust; eye irritation; geometry; headache; nose congestion; perception; prevalence; primary school; priority journal; sore throat; suspended particulate matter; ventilator";;Scopus

Over the past four decades it has released large amounts of volcanic gases and aerosols which form vol-canic air pollution known as 'vog'. Communities downwind of Kilauea have been chronically or episodically exposed to this potentially harmful air pollution and have raised concerns about the hazards of vog exposure. Public health and civil protection agencies have offered a range of ad -vice, information, and mitigation strategies for living with vog. In this mixed-methods social study, we investigate the translation of official advice into practice in Island of Hawai'i communi-ties and assess how risk communication could be improved by considering public input, prefer-ences, and community relevance. Given the paucity of information on the long-term effects of chronic vog exposure, assessing the effectiveness of public health and risk communication is vi-tal. In 2015, through questionnaire surveys (n = 143), four focus groups and several stakeholder meetings, we assessed whether, and how, residents accessed intervention advice, if it was rele-vant and useful, how they acted on it and how they would like to receive advice and urgent expo-sure warnings in the future. We also investigated local knowledge and self-developed interven-tions and documented the perceived risks of vog exposure, including symptoms that people at-tribute to vog. Most participants (83%) perceived that vog caused health symptoms such as exacerbation of asthma, itchy eyes, and blocked nose and 62% thought it was harmful to their long-term health. A third of participants had considered relocating to avoid the vog yet, despite this, most people took no action to reduce vog exposure. Participants reported that the official advice was difficult to follow given their living situation or lifestyle. Some participants viewed the agency advice as in -consistent, irrelevant, or out of date. Participants preferred to receive advice and air quality alerts via a variety of media, depending on factors such as their access to internet, cell phone, and radio reception. The study findings led to a collaboration with federal and state health, land management, ed-ucational, science, and civil protection agencies to improve and standardize health advisory mes-saging, to make it more relevant to Island of Hawai'i communities and environment. New print- able and web-based communication products were developed, which included local knowledge of effective protective actions/symptom reduction strategies. An interagency 'Vog Dashboard' was also introduced to consolidate vog knowledge, including sources of air quality data, vog fore-casts, and advice on vog environmental, agricultural, and health impacts. This dashboard was recommended as a primary site for advice by international media outlets in 2018 and was heavily used during the 2018 Kilauea and 2022 Mauna Loa eruption crises.;"Hawaii; Volcano; Risk communication; Air pollution; Vog; Perceptions; Exposure mitigation";;"KILAUEA VOLCANO; HEALTH; DISPERSION; CRISIS; TRUST; VOG";WOS

Aims: Examine associations of gestational and childhood exposure to traffic-related pollution with executive function and behavior problems in children. Methods: We studied associations of pre- and postnatal pollution exposures with neurobehavioral outcomes in 1212 children in the Project Viva pre-birth cohort followed to mid-childhood (median age 7.7 years). Parents and classroom teachers completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Using validated spatiotemporal models, we estimated exposure to black carbon (BC) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the third trimester of pregnancy, from birth to 3 years, from birth to 6 years, and in the year before behavioral ratings. We also measured residential distance to major roadways and near-residence traffic density at birth and-in mid-childhood. We estimated associations of BC, PM2.5, and other traffic exposure measures with BRIEF and SDQ scores, adjusted for potential confounders. Results: Higher childhood BC exposure was associated with higher teacher-rated BRIEF Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) scores, indicating greater problems: 1.0 points (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.0, 2.1) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in birth-age 6 BC, and 1.7 points (95% CI: 0.6, 2.8) for BC in the year prior to behavioral ratings. Mid childhood residential traffic density was also associated with BRI score (0.6, 95% CI: 0.1,1.1). Birth-age 3 BC was not associated with BRIEF or SDQscores. Third trimester BC exposure was not associated with teacher-rated BRI scores ( -0.2, 95% CI: -1.1, 0.8), and predicted lower scores (fewer problems) on the BRIEF Metacognition Index (-1.2, 95% CI: -2.2, -0.2) and SDQ total difficulties (-0.9, 95% CI: -1.4, -0.4). PM2.5 exposure was associated with teacher-rated BRIEF and SDQscores in minimally adjusted models but associations attenuated with covariate adjustment. None of the parent-rated outcomes suggested adverse effects of greater pollution exposure at any time point. Conclusions: Children with higher mid-childhood exposure to BC and greater near-residence traffic density in mid childhood had greater problems with behavioral regulation as assessed by classroom teachers, but not as assessed by parents. Prenatal and early childhood exposure to traffic-related pollution did not predict greater executive function or behavior problems; third trimester BC was associated with lower scores (representing fewer problems) on measures of metacognition and behavioral problems.

The participants were followed up for 9 months. The primary outcomes were differences in the score of St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for patients with COPD (SGRQ-C) and COPD assessment test (CAT) from baseline.Results: A total of 106 participants were enrolled and 102 completed the study. At the end of the study, the intervention group showed significant improvements in the primary outcomes compared to the control group, with a group difference of-5.9 in the reduction of total SGRQ-C (-3.4 vs. 2.5; p = 0.049) and-3.8 in the CAT score (-1.2 vs. 2.7; p = 0.001). Participants with good adherence to the intervention demonstrated a greater extent of improvement in CAT score and lower PM2.5 levels compared to those who had poor adherence or were in the control group.

A real-time grasp of the dynamic public environment perception of emotions is often an important basis for environmental management departments to effectively solve environmental problems through public opinion. This article focuses on the problem of the public perception of emotional changes, which is caused by fog and hazy weather, proposes an environmental emotion perception model, using Weibo comment data about fog and haze as environmental perception data, and analyzes the impact of fog and haze on the public in four seasonal time dimensions. The post-environment perception of emotion changes: the results show that in spring, the public's environmental perception of emotions is mainly negative emotions at the beginning of the season; in summer, positive emotions become dominant emotions; in autumn, the public's environmental perception of emotions is dominated by negative emotions that increase substantially; and in winter, the dominant environmental perception of emotions of the public is still negative.

However, exposure-response models for this relationship have not been developed. One of the main challenges is to identify a compound that can be used as proxy for livestock odor exposure. In this paper we developed models that describe the relationship between long-term averaged outdoor residential ammonia (NH3) exposures and livestock odor annoyance experienced by rural residents, and investigated person-related variables associated with annoyance responses. We used emission-based atmospheric dispersion modeling data to estimate household-specific outdoor concentrations and survey data to characterize the study subjects. Binomial and multinomial logistic regressions were used for model development. Residential NH3 exposure was positively associated with moderate, high and extreme odor annoyance (adjusted odds ratio = 10.59: 95% confidence interval: 1.35-83.13, for each unit increase in Log(e)NH(3) exposure). Specific characteristics of the exposed subjects (i.e., age, time per week spent at home, presence of children at home and job) act as co-determinants of odor annoyance responses. Predictive models showed classification accuracies of 67-72%. The results suggest that NH3 exposure in the residential outdoor environment can be used as a predictor of livestock odor annoyance in population studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

When changing from mixing ventilation to FVS, the pupils (N = 26) perceived better air quality (P = 0.006) and less dyspnoea (P = 0.007) as compared to controls (N = 35), and BUT was improved (P = 0.03). At desk level, mean CO2 was reduced from 867 to 655 ppm. Formaldehyde and viable bacteria were numerically lower, while total bacteria and molds were higher with displacement ventilation. There was no difference in symptoms or signs when changing from FVS to FMS. Cat (Der p1), dog (Can f1) and horse allergen (Equ cx) were common in air at all conditions. In conclusion, displacement ventilation may have certain positive health effects among pupils, as compared to conventional mixing ceiling systems.";"Displacement ventilation; Biomarkers; School environment; Pupils; Tear film stability (BUT)";"Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Canis familiaris; Equidae; Air; Air quality; Allergens; Bacteria; Indoor air pollution; Mixing; Quality control; Ventilation; Displacement ventilation; Elementary schools; Film stability; Health effects; Mixing ventilation; Pupil; School environment; Tear film stability (BUT); Tear films; Ventilation systems; Floors";"COMPUTER CLASSROOMS; ALLERGEN LEVELS; NASAL PATENCY; EXCHANGE-RATE; ASTHMA; ROOMS; PERFORMANCE; ENVIRONMENT; BIOMARKERS; SWEDEN";WOS
403;10.1186/s12909-023-04785-1;Short animated video increases knowledge and perceived comfort in clinical counseling on inequitable health impacts of air pollution among interprofessional health learners and clinicians;United States;;"Doheny, BM; Inglis, JJ; Boll, KA; Lunos, S; Surapaneni, VL";2023;BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION;23;1;BackgroundAir pollution is a major health risk contributing to global morbidity and mortality, yet clinicians do not routinely engage in counseling patients on this topic. Clinicians cite their lack of education as a common barrier. We developed a two-minute animated video on mitigating air pollution health risks and evaluated the efficacy of this video as an educational tool.MethodsIn March-June 2021, a convenience sample of Minnesota interprofessional health learners and clinicians viewed the video and completed an electronic survey that assessed pre-/post-video intervention changes in (a) didactic and clinically applied knowledge on health impacts of air pollution, (b) perceived comfort in identifying at-risk patients and counseling them on relevant preventive health behaviors, (c) intentions/barriers to counseling patients, (d) beliefs and attitudes related to the health harms of air pollution, and (e) perceptions of the overall acceptability of the intervention.ResultsThe 218 participants included learners and clinicians in medicine, nursing, and advanced practice provision. Respondents' knowledge scores and self-reported level of comfort in identifying high-risk patients and counseling them on preventative health behaviors increased significantly pre-/post-intervention. The video also effectively altered participants' misperceptions about the health impacts of air pollution. While less than half of participants (43.6%) reported they intended to engage in counseling patients as a result of watching the video, 52.3% indicated they might do so. Lack of time during clinical encounters and lack of training were reported as persistent barriers to engaging in this counseling. Overall, participants found the video to be an effective educational tool, indicating that they wanted their colleagues and patients to watch the video and would like to see further short, animated videos on other environmental health topics.ConclusionsA two-minute animated educational video significantly improved knowledge of inequitable health impacts of air pollution and improved perceived comfort in identifying and counseling at-risk patients among health professional learners and clinicians regardless of profession, level of training, or pre-intervention knowledge level. Academic health professional training programs and health systems should consider adopting this modality as a tool for educating learners, clinicians, and patients on environmental health risks.;"Climate; Air pollution; Health equity; Clinical encounter; Climate change; Counseling; Climate change health impacts; Health and social inequities; Social justice; Environmental health; Health behavior; Health risk behavior; Professional education";"Air Pollution; Counseling; Health Behavior; Health Personnel; Humans; Minnesota; adult; air pollution; article; climate change; comfort; comparative effectiveness; convenience sample; counseling; environmental health; female; health behavior; health equity; health hazard; health practitioner; high risk patient; human; major clinical study; male; Minnesota; nursing; occupation; perception; risk assessment; social justice; training; videorecording; vocational education; education; health behavior; health care personnel; prevention and control";"CLIMATE-CHANGE; MEMBERS; VISITS";WOS

Although there has been substantial traditional consideration of the objective impact of air pollution, more knowledge is needed about perceived air quality (PAQ), its association with objective air pollution (OAP), and the relationship between OAP and PAQ with respect to pro-environmental behavior (PEB).MethodsTo delineate and investigate the effect of air pollution on both perceived and objective perspectives of PEB and its underlying psychological mechanisms, this study distributed a survey questionnaire related to PAQ, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), satisfaction with local governmental control of air quality (SAT), and the PEB scale. The monitored data of objective city-level air pollution and 391 samples of survey data were included in this study.ResultsThe results reveal that both PAQ and OAP increase individuals' negative affect (NA) and decrease SAT, which sequentially restrains PEB. More importantly, PAQ, NA, and SAT played mediating roles in the relationship between OAP and PEB. Empirical testing for group difference also indicated that while there is no gender-related difference with respect to caring about SAT and PEB caused by air pollution, gender effects on NA were significantly different. Age-related differences exist among younger, medium, and older age groups with respect to NA, SAT, and PEB caused by air pollution, and there are also background differences with respect to NA, SAT, and PEB, although income does not generate a significant group difference effect on NA, SAT, and PEB.ConclusionsThe findings corroborate the important roles of affect and SAT in activating public concern about air quality. We discuss the possible ways that affect and SAT might enhance PEB as well as the limitations of this study. More pollutants and mechanisms could be considered in future studies.;"Perceived air quality; Objective air pollution; Negative affect; Satisfaction with the local air quality; Pro-environmental behavior";;"LIFE SATISFACTION; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; RESPIRATORY HEALTH; ANNOYANCE SCORES; MENTAL-HEALTH; PERCEPTION; HAPPINESS; EXPOSURE; CHINA; RISK";WOS

It has recently been patented and presented a novel individual endonasal disposable medical device (temporarily named Smart Nose), consisting in a couple of small cone trunks with an internal helix (the entire tool in soft medical silicone), which ""captures"" and eliminates airborne particulate matter, in particular of polluting origin (PM) but also of allergic nature. Air clearance from such noxious particles has been assessed, as well as nasal resistances, with different configurations of the device, and consequently the most ""equilibrated"" geometry has been selected considering the best possible ""filtering"" efficiency vs the best possible respect of nasal respiratory patency. The ""capturing"" properties of the device are due to a special biogel stratified on the internal surface of each cone trunk and helix: such biogel captures PM due to its electrostatic properties, fixes it thank to its high viscosity and eliminates it (it's disposable). Aim. This paper presents the results of a survey on the opinion of a sample of citizens about the potential agreement on such individual defense from atmospheric pollutants and other airborne noxious particles. Subjects andmethod.The interwiewed persons were 279 common citizens transiently exposed to urban outdoor pollution, but also persons more ""sensible"" to pollution and airborne particle-derived problems: 19 citizens suffering from allergic oculorhinitis and bronchial asthma, 50 workers operating in an open urban context or unhealthy environment, plus 52 snorers not belonging to such last two categories. Results. The survey in general has demonstrated high interest of the interviewed persons towards Smart Nose: a positive impression has been referred by 70% common citizens, 84% allergics, 73% ""polluted"" workers. 46% snorers. About 50% of the potential users are convinced about the utility of the device by the description of its characteriscics, others would prefer to test it in advance. Neither invasivity nor fear of unpleasant nasal sensations are likely to constitute a problem: a proposed costless proof is accepted by >90% of the sample, specially by younger people. Conclusion. Exposure to the inhalation to noxious particulate matter is a sensible problem for the citizens, specially those exposed to PM for professional reasons or allergic to pollens and other airborne allergens; less for subjects suffering from disturbances whose solution is linked to proper curative measures more than to preventive ones (snorers). Hope in possible measures intended to clear inspired air passes also through the expectance of relatively costless individual solutions such as that represented by Smart Nose device.";"Aero-allergens; Air pollution; Medical device; Opinion survey; Particulate matter";"allergen; air pollution; air pollution control; allergic rhinitis; asthma; cost benefit analysis; device; disposable equipment; endonasal disposable device; health care survey; human; interview; nose airway resistance; occupational exposure; particulate matter; pollen allergy; review; snoring; urban area";;Scopus

Every year millions of respiratory diseases and premature deaths are directly attributed to it. Therefore, people who suffer from respiratory diseases are more vulnerable to variations in air quality, as direct exposure leads to exacerbation of symptoms, more hospitalizations, and behavioral changes. This study aims to examine the impact of air pollution on the travel behavior of people with respiratory diseases. To accomplish this objective, a mixed methodological approach is used, applying questionnaires and interviews. The results show that visitors with respiratory diseases are more likely to value air quality and to engage in adaptive measures to prevent the effects of air pollution episodes at the destination. This study enriches the tourism literature by examining how air quality influences visitors with respiratory illnesses and provides practical implications for the tourism industry.;"Tourism; Respiratory diseases; Air quality; Adaptive behaviors; Travel behavior";;"PARTICULATE MATTER; INBOUND TOURISM; POLLUTION; IMPACT; CHINA; SMOG; SEGMENTATION; ASSOCIATION; RESPONSES; PORTUGAL";WOS

Questionnaires for primary school aged children have traditionally been parent-administered, but self-administered questionnaires would be easier to administer and may yield as good, if not better, information. Our aim was to compare the repeatability of self- and parent-administered indoor air questionnaires designed for primary school aged pupils. Methods: Indoor air questionnaire with questions on child's symptoms and perceived indoor air quality in schools was sent to parents of pupils aged 7-12 years in two schools and again after two weeks. Slightly modified version of the questionnaire was administered to pupils aged 9-12 years in another two schools and repeated after a week. 351 (52%) parents and 319 pupils (86%) answered both the first and the second questionnaire. Test-retest repeatability was assessed with intra-class correlation (ICC) and Cohen's kappa coefficients (k). Results: Test-retest repeatability was generally between 0.4-0.7 (ICC; k) in both self-and parent-administered questionnaire. In majority of the questions on symptoms and perceived indoor air quality test-retest repeatability was at the same level or slightly better in self-administered compared to parent-administered questionnaire. Agreement of self-and parent administered questionnaires was generally < 0.4 (ICC; k) in reported symptoms and 0.4-0.6 (ICC; k) in perceived indoor air quality. Conclusions: Children aged 9-12 years can give as, or even more, repeatable information about their respiratory symptoms and perceived indoor air quality than their parents. Therefore, it may be possible to use self-administered questionnaires in future studies also with children.";"Repeatability; Symptoms; Indoor air questionnaire";"Abdominal Pain; Air Pollution, Indoor; Arthralgia; Asthma; Child; Cough; Dust; Fatigue; Female; Fever; Finland; Headache; Hoarseness; Humans; Male; Odorants; Parents; Pharyngitis; Reproducibility of Results; Respiratory Sounds; Schools; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; fragrance; air quality; ambient air; Article; asthma; case control study; child; child parent relation; controlled study; correlation coefficient; female; Finland; human; information processing; kappa statistics; male; measurement repeatability; population research; prevalence; questionnaire; school child; self report; test retest repeatability; abdominal pain; abnormal respiratory sound; arthralgia; asthma; coughing; dust; fatigue; fever; headache; hoarseness; indoor air pollution; pathophysiology; pharyngitis; reproducibility; school; self report";"HEALTH; ASTHMA; AGREEMENT; PREVALENCE; SCHOOLCHILDREN; POLLUTION; RESPONSES; KAPPA; VIDEO; WORK";WOS

416;10.1371/journal.pone.0196783;The mediating role of risk perception in the association between industry-related air pollution and health;Netherlands;;"Bergstra, AD; Brunekreef, B; Burdorf, A";2018;PLOS ONE;13;5;Background Heavy industry emits many potentially hazardous pollutants into the air which can affect health. Awareness about the potential health impacts of air pollution from industry can influence people's risk perception. This in turn can affect (self-reported) symptoms. Our aims were to investigate the associations of air pollution from heavy industry with health symptoms and to evaluate whether these associations are mediated by people's risk perception about local industry. Methods A cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted among children (2-18 years) and adults (19 years and above) living in the direct vicinity of an area with heavy industry. A dispersion model was used to characterize individual-level exposures to air pollution emitted from the industry in the area. Associations between PM2.5 and NOx with presence of chronic diseases (adults) and respiratory symptoms (adults and children) were investigated by logistic regression analysis. Risk perception was indirectly measured by worries about local industry (0-10 scale). Mediation analyses were performed to investigate the role of mediation by these worries. Results The response was 54% (2,627/4,877). In adults exposure to modelled PM2.5 from industry (per mu g/m(3)) was related with reported high blood pressure (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.13-2.15) and exposure to modelled NOx (per mu g/m(3)) was inversely related with cardiovascular diseases (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.98). In children higher PM2.5 and NOx concentrations (per mu g/m(3)) were related with wheezing (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.24-3.24 and OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.21 respectively) and dry cough (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.55-3.52 and OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.10-1.22 respectively). Parental worry about local industry was an important mediator in exposure-health relations in children (indirect effect between 19-28%). Conclusion Exposure from industry was associated with self-reported reported high blood pressure among adults and respiratory symptoms among their children. Risk perception was found to mediate these associations for children.;;"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Attitude to Health; Child; Child, Preschool; Chronic Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Health Behavior; Humans; Hypertension; Manufacturing and Industrial Facilities; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Nitrogen Oxides; Particulate Matter; Respiration Disorders; Risk Assessment; Smoking; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; benzene; dioxin; ethylene; formaldehyde; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; toluene; adult; aged; air pollution; Article; asthma; cardiovascular disease; child; chronic bronchitis; chronic disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; coughing; cross-sectional study; educational status; environmental exposure; female; health behavior; health impact assessment; human; hypertension; industry; lung emphysema; male; Netherlands; perception; population group; prevalence; questionnaire; risk; smoking; wheezing; young adult; adolescent; air pollutant; air pollution; attitude to health; breathing disorder; chronic disease; clinical trial; environmental health; hypertension; middle aged; multicenter study; particulate matter; preschool child; psychology; risk assessment; socioeconomics; toxicity";"RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; CHILDHOOD ISAAC; LUNG-FUNCTION; ASTHMA; CHILDREN; PREVALENCE; ALLERGIES; ANNOYANCE; EXPOSURE; SITE";WOS

This scoping review aimed to identify previous research evaluating individuals' perceptions of air pollution and its health effects, and to explore the measurement of perceptions, as a key resource for health behaviour.MethodsThe review followed the methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. PubMed and Web of Science were searched. After initial and full-text screening, we further selected studies with standardised scales that had previously been tested for reliability and validity in assessing awareness and perceptions.ResultsAfter full-text screening, 95 studies were identified. 'Perception/awareness of air quality' was often measured, as well as 'Perception of health risk.' Only nine studies (9.5%) used validated scaled questionnaires. There was considerable variation in the scales used to measure the multiple dimensions of risk perception for air pollution.ConclusionFew studies used structured scales to quantify individuals' perceptions, limiting comparisons among studies. Standardised methods for measuring health risk perception are needed. Main findings: Among 95 studies assessing health risk perception of air pollution, only nine studies used standardised scales.Added knowledge: There was considerable variation in the scales measuring the multiple dimensions of risk perception for air pollution, which makes comparison among the studies difficult.Global health impact for policy and action: This review highlights the need for the development of globally standardised scale to measure the health risk perception of air pollution.;"Air pollution; air quality; health risk; health risk perception; standardised scales; awareness";"Air Pollution; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Perception; Risk Assessment; Surveys and Questionnaires; adverse event; air pollution; attitude to health; human; perception; procedures; questionnaire; risk assessment";"QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PERCEIVED HEALTH; ENVIRONMENTAL RISK; PUBLIC PERCEPTION; URBAN; AWARENESS; KNOWLEDGE; EXPOSURE; EXPERIENCE; SMOG";WOS

It explores nine crucial variables: Effort Expectancy (EE), Performance Expectancy (PE), Social Influence (SI), Facilitating Condition (FC), Hedonic Motivation (HM), Price Value (PV), Habit (HB), and TR using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) framework. Data collection involved 371 participants via surveys and questionnaires, with demographic variables such as Gender (G), Age (A), and Location (L) serving as moderating factors. Analysis conducted with smart-pls 4.0 software revealed a notable correlation between TR and BIU, identifying HM as the most pivotal factor. The study's theoretical and practical contributions offer a nuanced understanding of the integration between TR features and the UTAUT2 model, highlighting HM's critical role in influencing AQMS user behaviors. Furthermore, it delivers strategic insights for developers and policymakers aimed at improving air quality monitoring systems. The research enhances the comprehension of technology adoption dynamics in environmental surveillance, setting the groundwork for refining AQMS's deployment and efficacy. It aligns technological innovations with user inclinations, underscoring the combined effects of TR and HM on AQMS-related user actions. Ultimately, the findings illuminate TR's significance and interplay within the UTAUT2 framework, providing actionable recommendations for crafting more effective air quality monitoring solutions.;"Air quality; behavioral intention to use (BIU); AQMS; technology readiness (TR); pollutant";"Behavioral research; Economic and social effects; Environmental technology; Air quality monitoring; Air quality monitoring solution; Behavioral intention; Behavioral intention to use; Hedonic motivations; Intention to use; Pollutant; Technology readiness; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Air quality";"ACCEPTANCE; ADOPTION; MODEL; MANAGEMENT; POLLUTION; COVID-19; BANKING";WOS
