6;How Does Low Relative Humidity Affect Perceived Air Quality, Thermal Comfort and Symptoms in Modern Office Buildings in Cold Climates?;"Lind, M; Holos, S; Thunshelle, K; Yang, A; Mysen, M";To assess how people are influenced by relative humidity (RH) in cold climates, a study was conducted in an open office landscape in Oslo, Norway. The study took place during three cold days in February 2017. Fourteen subjects were blindly exposed to different levels of RH in the order of low (14 +/- 1%), high (38 +/- 3%), and medium (24 +/- 4%). The subjects received emails twice a day (at 12:00 and at 14:30) with a link to a webpage where they were asked to: (1) assess perceived air quality (PAQ), (2) respond to a questionnaire about indoor environment quality and symptoms. The subjects performed normal office activity in between the two sessions. We found no significant impact of the level of RH on PAQ. Nevertheless, there were significantly more complaints about dry air at low RH than at medium and high RH. Furthermore, the air was perceived to be significantly more stuffy and heavier at high RH than at medium RH. There were no significant differences in thermal comfort at different RH, yet more people complained that it was cold on the day with low RH and warm on the day with high RH. Generally, there were few complaints related to symptoms at different RH. There were however significantly more complaints of itching and burning in the eyes at low RH than at medium and high RH.;"Relative humidity; Perceived air quality; Thermal comfort; Dry air; Symptoms";;"INDOOR; TEMPERATURE; IMPACT";0;0;0;0;0;0;Andina
15;Health protection and climate change require ambitious limit values for air pollutants in Europe. Opinion on the revision of the Directive on Air Quality and Clean Air for Europe of the Environmental Public Health commission of the Robert Koch Institute and the Federal Environment Agency;"Peters, A; Herr, C; Bolte, G; Heutelbeck, A; Hornberg, C; Kraus, T; Lakes, T; Matzarakis, A; Novak, D; Reifegerste, D; Traidl-Hoffmann, C; Zeeb, H; Schneider, A; Hoffmann, B";Based on scientific findings, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended stricter guideline values for air quality in 2021. Significant reductions in the annual mean values of particulatematter (particle size 2.5 mu m or smaller, PM2.5) and long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3) were put forward. The risk of mortality already increases above the WHO guideline values, as shown in studies investigating low concentrations of air pollutants. In Germany, the 2021 WHO guideline values for PM2.5 and NO2 were clearly exceeded in 2022. In this position paper we give the following recommendations for the European Air Quality Directive: (1) set binding limit values according to WHO 2021, (2) apply the limit values to the whole of Europe, (3) continue and expand the established country-based monitoring networks, (4) expand air quality measurements for ultrafine particles and soot particles, and (5) link air pollution control and climate protectionmeasures. Stricter limits for air pollutants require societal and political changes in areas such as mobility, energy use and generation, and urban and spatial planning. Implementation according to WHO 2021 would lead to a net economic benefit of 38 billion euros per year. Ambitious limit values for air pollutants also have an impact on climate changemitigation and its health impacts. The Environmental Public Health commission concludes that more ambitious limit values are crucial to enable effective health protection in Germany and calls for air pollutant limit values in line with the 2021 WHO recommendations to become binding in Europe.;"Air pollutants; Air quality; Health protection; Climate change; Burden of disease";"Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Climate Change; Europe; Germany; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Public Health; nitrogen dioxide; air pollutant; air pollution; climate change; Europe; Germany; particulate matter; prevention and control; public health";;0;0;0;0;0;0;Andina
38;Investigation of NO2 Behaviour in the Temperate Continental Climate Road Environment;"Sereviciene, V; Baltrenas, P; Baltrenaite, E; Marciulaitiene, E; Paliulis, D";During an extended period from 2010-2012 ambient air quality researches, concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the air was measured applying the passive method. In order to evaluate the spatial distribution of pollutants and the major sources, 12 sampling sites across the region were chosen. Additionally, the seasonal changes of this pollutant under different meteorological conditions (air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction) were investigated. The long-term study showed 3.8 times higher NO2 concentrations in the Mazeikiai urban area (24.2 mu g m(-3)) as compared to other locations in the region (6.3 mu g m(-3)). This confirms the assumption that the main source of NO2 in this area is motor vehicle exhaust fumes. The analysis of the results obtained in different seasons showed a significant difference (p<0.05) in NO2 concentrations under different meteorological conditions. The increase in NO2 concentrations was recorded in the winter and late autumn seasons, due to reduced solar radiation and lower temperatures. Cluster analysis results showed that sampling sites can be grouped into different classes based on NO2 main source, motor vehicles and traffic intensity.;"Air pollution; Crude oil refinery; Nitrogen dioxide; Passive samplers; Seasonal variation";;"AMBIENT NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; AIR-QUALITY; PASSIVE SAMPLERS; STACK EMISSIONS; POLLUTION; URBAN; POLLUTANTS; REFINERY; VICINITY; COMPLEX";0;0;0;0;0;0;Andina
49;Is there a stronger willingness to pay for air quality improvement with high education: new evidence from a survey in China;"Hu, L; Liao, WM";As a developing country with the largest population and serious environmental pollution in the world, China has made great efforts in air pollution. Air quality improvement depends not only on government administrative regulations but also on public support, especially how much the public is willing to pay for air quality improvement. Higher education will encourage the public to take action to improve air quality. However, the confirmation of the causality relationship between WTP and education has been missing. This study uses the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) to find the relationship between the two, and the conclusions are drawn: OLS regression model and instrumental variable both determine the positive influence of education level on air quality improvement WTP, and Heckman model further verifies the robustness of the conclusion. The positive influence of education level is greater in the groups of men, higher income, higher awareness of acid rain, and more air purifiers, and it has a greater impact on married people in rural areas than in urban areas. The function mechanism of education can improve residents' WTP by increasing regional GDP, promoting urbanization level, expanding afforestation areas, decreasing private car ownership and the number of newly registered civil cars, and reducing sulfur dioxide emissions, nitrogen oxides, and smoke (powder) dust. The total social and economic value of air quality improvement in China is 34.572 billion CNY to 672.42 trillion CNY.;"Air quality improvement; Willingness to pay; Education level; Instrumental variable; Compulsory education law";"Air Pollution; China; Educational Status; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Male; Quality Improvement; China; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission control; higher education; rural area; urbanization; willingness to pay; air pollution; China; educational status; human; male; pollution; total quality management";"POLLUTION; VALUATION; EMISSIONS; HEALTH";0;0;1;0;0;1;Andina
143;Influence of travel behaviour and daily mobility on exposure to traffic-related air pollution;"Shekarrizfard, M; Minet, L; Miller, E; Yusuf, B; Weichenthal, S; Hatzopoulou, M";This study evaluates the daily exposure of urban residents across various commuting modes and destinations by intersecting data from a travel survey with exposure surfaces for ultrafine particles and black carbon, in Toronto, Canada. We demonstrate that exposure misclassification is bound to arise when we approximate daily exposure with the concentration at the home location. We also identify potential inequities in the distribution of exposure to traffic-related air pollution whereby those who are mostly responsible for the generation of traffic-related air pollution (drivers and passengers) are exposed the least while active commuters and transit riders, are exposed the most.;"Traffic; Air pollution; Exposure; Mobility; Land-use regression; Ultrafine particles; Black carbon";"Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Canada; Environmental Exposure; Particulate Matter; Soot; Vehicle Emissions; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto; black carbon; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; concentration (composition); land use; pollution exposure; regression analysis; traffic emission; adult; Article; Canada; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; comparative study; driver; dust exposure; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; female; home; human; male; middle aged; mobilization; particulate matter; priority journal; toxic concentration; traffic pollution; travel; urban population; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; soot; toxicity";HEALTH;0;0;0;0;0;0;Andina
174;Roles of socio-physical environments on air quality control policy with respect to knowledge, attitude and intention;"Nguyen, KLP; Chuang, YH; Yu, RF; Chen, CY; Chen, HW";Human behavior altered in different socioeconomic conditions is the main contributor to deteriorating air quality, therefore changing the behavior is the goal of air policies. In this study, we propose an integrated framework to figure out the roles of socio-physical environments in promoting air quality control policies through behavioral perspectives. The study selects Changhua County in Central Taiwan, composed of 26 cities and townships, as a case study to investigate the impacts of social and economic factors and the air quality on individual's knowledge, attitude and behavioral intention. The socioeconomic and environmental factors are collected from Taiwanese official information, while the knowledge, attitude, and intention toward the policies are obtained through questionnaires. Subsequently, multivariate analysis techniques including principal component analysis and redundancy analysis are utilized to simultaneously identify the causal relationships between socio-physical environments and the knowledge, attitude, and intention in different townships. Our findings suggest that individual's knowledge, attitude, and intention toward the air polices cannot be raised simply in commensurate with the growth of the economy and the deterioration of air quality. Indeed, people living in highly urbanized regions and being well-educated, particularly in Changhua City, are less willing to take actions for air quality improvement although they are susceptible to environmental risks. On the contrary, people close to nature have more environmental knowledge, positive attitudes and more intentions to improve the air quality. The finding results will be beneficial to authorities in each city/township to organize environmental education plans corresponding to their socioeconomic conditions and behavioral patterns.

302;When Do Governments Support Common Goods for Health? Four Cases on Surveillance, Traffic Congestion, Road Safety, and Air Pollution;"Bump, JB; Reddiar, SK; Soucat, A";Common goods such as air, water, climate, and other resources shared by all humanity are under increasing pressure from growing population and advancing globalization of the world economy. Safeguarding these resources is generally considered a government responsibility, as common goods are vulnerable to market failure. However, governments do not always fulfill this role, and face many challenges in doing so. This observation-that governments only sometimes address common goods problems-informs the central question of this paper: when do governments act in support of common goods? We structure our inquiry using a framework derived from three theories of agenda setting, emphasizing problem perception, the role of actors and collective action patterns, strategies and policies, and catalyzing circumstances. We used a poll of experts to identify important common goods for health: disease surveillance, environmental protection, and accountability. We then chose four historical cases for analysis: the establishment of the Epidemic Intelligence Service in the US, transport planning in London, road safety in Argentina, and air quality control in urban India. Our analysis of the collective evidence of these cases suggests that decisions to advance government action on common goods require a concisely articulated problem, a well-defined strategy for addressing the problem, and leadership backed by at least a few important groups willing to cooperate. Our cases reveal a variety of collective action patterns, suggesting that there are many routes to success. We consider that the timing of an intervention in support of common goods depends on favorable circumstances, which can include a catalyzing event but does not necessarily require one.;"collective action; common goods; global health history; government failure; public health";"Air Pollution; Argentina; Government Programs; Humans; India; London; Population Surveillance; Safety; Social Justice; United States; adverse event; air pollution; Argentina; England; government; health survey; human; India; legislation and jurisprudence; procedures; safety; social justice; United States";"DISEASE; TIME; EPIDEMIC; FAILURE";0;0;1;0;1;1;Andina
414;Associations between Parents' Perceived Air Quality in Homes and Health among Children in Nanjing, China;"Qian, H; Zheng, XH; Zhang, M; Weschler, L; Sundell, J";The increasing prevalence of respiratory diseases in Chinese children has focused attention on indoor environmental quality. We investigated associations between perceived air quality in domestic environments and children's allergic diseases with a questionnaire survey study. A total of 4017 children aged 1-8 years old from 23 kindergartens in urban, suburban and industrial areas in Nanjing were randomly recruited for this study. Parents' perceived odors, including stuffy odor, unpleasant odor, pungent odor, moldy odor, humid air and dry air were found to be associated with asthma, wheeze, dry cough and rhinitis (P < 0.05). Both perceived dry and humid air were found to be positively associated with dampness indices, and we present evidence that the sensation of dryness may not be due to the actual indoor relative humidity, but rather to indoor air irritants. Parents' perception of odors and relative humidity may be indicators of environment pollutants, which are likely the real factors associated with children's allergic diseases.;;"Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Female; Health Status; Humans; Humidity; Hypersensitivity; Infant; Male; Odorants; Parents; Perception; Prevalence; Surveys and Questionnaires; fragrance; air pollutant; air quality; Article; asthma; child; child health; China; controlled study; coughing; dry mass; female; home environment; human; humidity; industrial area; male; odor; respiratory tract allergy; rhinitis; urban area; wheezing; child; health status; hypersensitivity; indoor air pollution; infant; parent; perception; preschool child; prevalence; psychology; questionnaire";"ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO-SMOKE; INDOOR-AIR; ALLERGIC SYMPTOMS; BUILDING CHARACTERISTICS; RESPIRATORY HEALTH; VENTILATION RATES; VOC EMISSIONS; BIRTH-COHORT; HOUSE-DUST; ASTHMA";1;0;0;1;0;1;Andina
453;UNINTENDED BENEFITS: LEADERSHIP SKILLS AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGE AMONG GUATEMALAN FIELDWORKERS EMPLOYED IN A LONGITUDINAL HOUSEHOLD AIR POLLUTION STUDY;"Kuo, D; Thompson, LM; Lee, A; Romero, C; Smith, KR";The RESPIRE and CRECER studies measured the effects of reduced household air pollution (HAP) from wood-fired cookstoves on respiratory health in rural highland Guatemala. This article examines behavior change and leadership skill development in local community members who were hired as fieldworkers to assist with research. Fieldworkers administered household questionnaires, shared functions similar to community health workers, and bridged health resources to communities. A mixed-methods design for data collection (in-depth interviews, focus groups, impact drawings, knowledge questionnaire, and retrospective pre-test) was used. Purposive sampling included 10 fieldworkers and 13 local service providers. Fieldworkers showed an increase in knowledge, positive attitudes, and practices around HAP. They developed new technical, interpersonal, and leadership skills. Fieldworkers played a crucial role in building confianza (trust) with the community, bridging resources, and improving outside researchers' relationships with locals. Recommendations for future researchers include inclusion of additional training courses and adoption of community participatory approaches.;;"Adult; Air Pollution, Indoor; Carbon Monoxide; Community Health Workers; Cooking; Female; Guatemala; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Promotion; Humans; Leadership; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Power (Psychology); Research Personnel; Steam Bath; carbon monoxide; adult; article; attitude to health; behavior; cooking; female; Guatemala; health auxiliary; health promotion; human; indoor air pollution; leadership; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; personnel; sauna";"COMMUNITY-HEALTH WORKERS; PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; EMPOWERMENT THEORY; WOMEN; YOUTH; EDUCATION; EXPOSURE; CHILDREN";1;1;0;0;0;1;Andina
112;The 'advancedness' of knowledge in pollution-saving technological change with a qualitative application to SO2 cap and trade;Grover D.;This paper investigates the extent to which 'advanced' knowledge and technology played a role in the SO2 compliance process in electric power plants under the US SO2 cap and trade program. It investigates the hypothesis that advanced knowledge and technology dedicated to pollution abatement played a minor role in that process while relatively unadvanced forms of knowledge and technology played the main role. New qualitative evidence in this somewhat well-known case is considered: interviews with electric power plant R&D managers, plant-level compliance data, and the changes undergone by boiler manufacturer, coal mining and railroad companies in the supply chain. Advanced knowledge dedicated to pollution abatement like the type now being emphasised for carbon capture and storage (CCS) played a minor role, while unadvanced knowledge and technology played the main role. While there are clearly limits to how far this unadvanced knowledge and technology finding can be generalised to GHG emission control, the specific aspects of the SO2 case that might be broadly informative of the response to GHG emissions are elaborated. In any case, the paper shows how 'innovation' in pollution control can be inexpensive and effective without involving very much advanced knowledge and technology for pollution control. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.;"Air pollution; Innovation; Knowledge; Supply chain; Technological change";"United States; atmospheric pollution; carbon sequestration; ecological economics; greenhouse gas; innovation; knowledge; pollution control; power plant; questionnaire survey; trade-off";;0;0;0;0;0;0;Andina
117;Influence of environmental variables on thermal comfort and air quality perception in office buildings in the humid subtropical climate zone of Brazil;"de Oliveira, CC; Rupp, RF; Ghisi, E";This study evaluates the influence of environmental variables on users' thermal comfort and air quality perception in the humid subtropical climate of Florianopolis, southern Brazil. A building with central air-conditioning system and three mixed-mode buildings, which alternated between natural ventilation and air-conditioning modes, were investigated. Statistical analyses were performed considering environmental data collected in situ between 2014 and 2016 - using microclimate stations, a portable thermo-anemometer and a CO2 analyser - and users' subjective responses obtained by means of an electronic questionnaire. Results showed a direct influence of air temperature and humidity ratio and indirect influence of air movement on thermal comfort. In addition, thermal, air movement and humidity sensation, preference and acceptability affected thermal comfort and air quality perception, highlighting the importance of carrying out a complete assessment of users' perception of the thermal environment. This work supports the use of the ASHRAE 55 adaptive thermal comfort model for mixed-mode buildings under natural ventilation operation. Based on the results obtained in this study, the use of hybrid ventilation strategy is recommended for energy savings due to reducing the use of air-conditioning and improving indoor air quality as there is a decrease in air pollutants level.

121;Social acceptance towards the air pollution in China: Evidence from public's willingness to pay for smog mitigation;"Sun, CW; Yuan, X; Yao, X";Air pollution is one of the most predominant challenges in China. In order to ensure the smog governance projects could be promoted smoothly and the public shoulder the environmental responsibilities consciously, it is necessary for the policymakers to take public attitude into consideration, and understand the public willingness to pay (WTP) for smog mitigation. This paper adopts a CV method framework to assess the value of WTP and analyze the determinants. Given the consideration of the possible presence of the selectivity bias caused by protest responses, the bivariate sample selection model is constructed for estimation. Results show that up to 14% of respondents hold the protest responses, and neglecting the selection bias caused by protest responses would lead to downward biased estimates. The mean value of WTP for the smog mitigation is 1590.36 RMB per year, accounting for about 1% of annual income. Moreover, the NIMBY (not in my backyard) attitude among public is found to be significantly correlated with their WTP, and the other determinants such as household annual income, energy expenditure and economic loss caused by smog could also substantially affect the value of WTP. We further recommend grading governance and policy transparency to address the smog crisis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

122;Does public opinion affect air quality? Evidence based on the monthly data of 109 prefecture-level cities in China;"Zhang, SL; Li, Y; Hao, Y; Zhang, YP";In recent years, serious smog and haze have shrouded vast areas of northern and eastern China, which has drawn broad attention at home and abroad. Although China is an authoritarian country with strict media control, public opinion may still affect air quality by putting pressure on the local and central governments to enhance environmental protections. In this paper, the impact of public opinion on air quality in China is for the first time quantitatively examined. Specifically, the monthly average levels of the Air Quality Index (AQI) and the concentrations of several main air pollutants, such as PM2.5, PM10 and SO2, are utilized as indicators for air quality. Using a dataset consisting of 109 prefecture-level Chinese cities for the period between November 2013 and October 2016, the estimation results indicate that air pollution significantly affects public opinion on air quality, and the surge in public opinion on air pollution occurs more frequently in the winter. Public opinion seems to have a positive effect on the environment only in the short run: air quality tends to improve two months after the surge in negative public opinion. In general, public opinion about air pollution helps to improve air quality in China.;"Public opinion; Air quality; Prefecture-level cities; China";"China; Air pollution; Air quality; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Air pollutants; Air quality indices; Central government; China; Estimation results; Evidence-based; Prefecture-level cities; Public opinions; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); environmental protection; estimation method; governance approach; haze; smog; Social aspects";"WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; POLLUTION; PM2.5; MEDIA; COMMUNICATION; CENSORSHIP; EXPOSURE; IMPACT; GROWTH";1;0;0;0;0;1;Andina
226;Inverted quarantine in the face of environmental change: Initiative defensive behaviors against air pollution in China;"Liu, WL; Du, CY; Chu, XP; Wang, ZH";People in China have become concerned with the health threats associated with severe air pollution. As a result, behavioural adjustments and pollutant filtration product implementation have become common means for people to cope with pollution threats in their daily lives. However, a systematic awareness of the basic characteristics and mechanisms of such behaviours is lacking. This paper focuses on how residents engage in inverted quarantine in response to air pollution. We examine in detail their behavioural responses by conducting a questionnaire survey. Results show that individual avoidance behaviours are quite diverse and combined. Masks have been identified as the most widely adopted filtration product with the lowest input costs. High-income groups have a higher tendency to purchase expensive filtering devices compared with low-income groups and prefer to combine multiple protection strategies. In addition to the driving effect of income, individual psychological perception plays an important role in the decision making of households. A lower public confidence in the government further encourages individual self-protection. These findings urge the government to enhance their air pollution control efforts and their timeliness of disclosing pollution information. The significant driving effects of individual cognition factors also call for a proper guidance to achieve a rational public perception of air pollution. Although the health benefits of using pollutant filtering devices have been widely discussed and proven, the increased energy consumption and other environmental impacts resulting from the use of such products are easily neglected. It demands the implementation of stricter market entrance, improved energy efficiency standards and enhanced waste management. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

240;Perceptions of Quality of Life and Pollution among China's Urban Middle Class: The Case of Smog in Tangshan;"Li, XY; Tilt, B";"After decades of rapid economic development, China is facing severe environmental problems. In particular, smog in urban areas has recently attracted a great deal of scientific and media attention both domestically and internationally. Our focus in this article is on public perceptions of smog in the northern city of Tangshan, which is routinely ranked as one of the urban areas with the worst air quality in the nation. In this article, we present the results of qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys with 341 urban residents. We examine how these residents perceive and weigh the importance of various aspects related to quality of life, including their experience with air pollution. Study participants considered environmental quality an issue of lower priority than many others; however, they surprisingly ranked it over economic concerns such as jobs and income. Their responses suggest that, for many urban residents, environmental problems like smog are fundamentally linked to basic quality of life concerns such as physical health and family well-being. We interpret our findings in the context of literature on the rise of China's middle class, the rise of environmental consciousness, and the role of gender in mediating perceptions of pollution and family health.

290;Traffic-related air pollution and perceived health risk: Lay assessment of an everyday hazard;Day, RJ;This article examines the perceived risks to health from traffic-related air pollution among residents of four neighbourhoods in a borough of north London. Drawing on interview and survey data, the first part of the discussion presents views on possible health effects in general terms, and perceived effects on respondents themselves and their families. Respiratory and allergic conditions were found to feature most consistently, while increased heart morbidity was associated with greater uncertainty. The article goes on to reflect on the epistemological processes underlying these beliefs, concluding that although these lay beliefs largely parallel current scientific understanding, there is an inherent tension between epistemological loyalties that will be important for those working with environmental health risks to understand.;"risk; lay knowledge; lay epidemiology; air pollution; health; environment";"air pollution; allergic disease; article; environmental exposure; environmental health; epistemology; exhaust gas; hazard assessment; health hazard; health survey; interview; morbidity; respiratory tract disease; United Kingdom";"ENVIRONMENTAL RISK; POPULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; URBAN; QUALITY; PERCEPTIONS; EXPERTISE";0;0;0;1;0;1;Andina
325;Adoption of Protective Behaviours: Residents Response to City Smog in Hefei, China;"Cheng, P; Wei, JC; Marinova, D; Guo, XM";City smog outbreaks in many Chinese cities aroused public concern about health risks and environmental pollution in China. This study investigates protective behaviours of the citizens in response to city smog using protective action decision to understand their actions. A survey was conducted in Hefei, Anhui in 2015, after the city experienced severe smog events. The data from 429 respondents supported the developed model. Hazard-related attributes were the strongest predictors for willingness to adopt protective behaviours. Public risk perception only positively affected self-protective actions. Information sources affected risk perception and increased the respondents' self-protective intentions. Older adults and respondents with lower educational levels were more likely to adopt environmentally friendly actions. The findings' theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.;;"Anhui; China; Hefei; action plan; decision making; environmental management; hazard assessment; health risk; public health; risk perception; smog";"PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR; SOCIAL AMPLIFICATION; RISK PERCEPTIONS; HAZARD; DETERMINANTS; ADJUSTMENT; INTERNET; VALUES";1;1;0;0;0;1;Andina
347;Public Perceptions of How Long Air Pollution and Carbon Dioxide Remain in the Atmosphere;"Dryden, R; Morgan, MG; Bostrom, A; de Bruin, WB";The atmospheric residence time of carbon dioxide is hundreds of years, many orders of magnitude longer than that of common air pollution, which is typically hours to a few days. However, randomly selected respondents in a mail survey in Allegheny County, PA (N = 119) and in a national survey conducted with MTurk (N = 1,013) judged the two to be identical (in decades), considerably overestimating the residence time of air pollution and drastically underestimating that of carbon dioxide. Moreover, while many respondents believed that action is needed today to avoid climate change (regardless of cause), roughly a quarter held the view that if climate change is real and serious, we will be able to stop it in the future when it happens, just as we did with common air pollution. In addition to assessing respondents' understanding of how long carbon dioxide and common air pollution stay in the atmosphere, we also explored the extent to which people correctly identified causes of climate change and how their beliefs affect support for action. With climate change at the forefront of politics and mainstream media, informing discussions of policy is increasingly important. Confusion about the causes and consequences of climate change, and especially about carbon dioxide's long atmospheric residence time, could have profound implications for sustained support of policies to achieve reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases.;"Air pollution; atmospheric residence time; carbon dioxide";"Allegheny County; Pennsylvania; United States; Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Pollution; Surveys; Atmospheric residence time; Carbon dioxide emissions; Mail surveys; Mainstream media; National surveys; Orders of magnitude; Public perception; Residence time; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; greenhouse gas; perception; questionnaire survey; residence time; Climate change";"GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; PEOPLE KNOW; CHANGE RISK; KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE";1;0;0;0;0;1;Andina
356;Designing a comprehensive behaviour change intervention to promote and monitor exclusive use of liquefied petroleum gas stoves for the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial;"Williams K.N.; Thompson L.M.; Sakas Z.; Hengstermann M.; Quinn A.; Diáz-Artiga A.; Thangavel G.; Puzzolo E.; Rosa G.; Balakrishnan K.; Peel J.; Checkley W.; Clasen T.F.; Miranda J.J.; Rosenthal J.P.; Harvey S.A.";Introduction Increasing use of cleaner fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and abandonment of solid fuels is key to reducing household air pollution and realising potential health improvements in low-income countries. However, achieving exclusive LPG use in households unaccustomed to this type of fuel, used in combination with a new stove technology, requires substantial behaviour change. We conducted theory-grounded formative research to identify contextual factors influencing cooking fuel choice to guide the development of behavioural strategies for the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial. The HAPIN trial will assess the impact of exclusive LPG use on air pollution exposure and health of pregnant women, older adult women, and infants under 1 year of age in Guatemala, India, Peru, and Rwanda. Methods Using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) framework and Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) to guide formative research, we conducted in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, observations, key informant interviews and pilot studies to identify key influencers of cooking behaviours in the four countries. We used these findings to develop behavioural strategies likely to achieve exclusive LPG use in the HAPIN trial. Results We identified nine potential influencers of exclusive LPG use, including perceived disadvantages of solid fuels, family preferences, cookware, traditional foods, non-food-related cooking, heating needs, LPG awareness, safety and cost and availability of fuel. Mapping formative findings onto the theoretical frameworks, behavioural strategies for achieving exclusive LPG use in each research site included free fuel deliveries, locally acceptable stoves and equipment, hands-on training and printed materials and videos emphasising relevant messages. In the HAPIN trial, we will monitor and reinforce exclusive LPG use through temperature data loggers, LPG fuel delivery tracking, in-home observations and behavioural reinforcement visits.

379;Perception of air quality and the thermal environment in offices;"Butala, V; Muhic, S";People's perception of the thermal environment and the quality of air in mechanically and naturally ventilated office environments is discussed. Interdisciplinary research of the indoor environment (technical and medical fields) was based on the simultaneous measurement of the thermal environment parameters, as well on as on surveying employees during their normal working activities. The survey sought to determine the health status and health problems of those surveyed in the 6 months prior to the study, as well as the current state of health and current subjective evaluation of the thermal environment and air quality. Deviations between the measured values evaluated by predicted mean vote (PMV) - predicted percent of dissatisfied (PPD) model (PMV-PDD) and the subjective evaluations of thermal environment of those surveyed were found. The subjectively stated reasons for the health problems of employees gave precedence to natural, as opposed to mechanical, ventilation, which is confirmed by the average absence from work for health reasons. An index of health was defined and analyzed for the people within a building. Significant correlations between indoor air parameters and the way people felt were found. Findings from the study indicate a significant role for the psychological factors and psychological state of the respondents when subjectively describing the indoor environment.;"thermal environment; perceived air quality; health index; symptom prevalence; well-being; air conditioning; natural ventilation";"carbon dioxide; volatile organic compound; absenteeism; adult; air conditioning; air quality; ambient air; article; building; environmental temperature; female; health status; health survey; human; humidity; male; occupational health; prediction; priority journal; psychological aspect";"SICK-BUILDING-SYNDROME; SYNDROME SBS; COMFORT; WORKERS";1;0;0;1;0;1;Andina
443;Level of Awareness about Air Pollution among Decision-makers in Jordan: Unveiling Important COPD Etiology;"Alrabadi, N; Alsayed, AR; Saadeh, R; AL Loze, KJ; Aljanabi, M; Al-Khamaiseh, AM";Purpose: The complete awareness of policymakers about air pollution can play a significant role in dealing with this environmental threat. This study aimed to examine the awareness and perception among the policymakers regarding air pollution in Jordan. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Jordan. The participants included in this study were governmental and non-governmental officials from different sectors. An interview and questionnaire were used to examine the extent of knowledge of these decision-makers regarding air pollution types, sources, and threats. Results: Most participants acknowledged that air pollution in Jordan was a huge problem. Most participants (90%) were familiar with the term air pollution, and regularly read about different contaminants that cause air pollution. However, most of the participants had a low level of knowledge about air contaminant types in Jordan. The least known pollutants were PM2.5 (Particulate Matter 2.5 microns in width) and PM10 (Particulate Matter 10 microns in width). Only 7.5% of the participants knew about PM2.5, while 12.5% knew about PM10. Conclusion: Policymakers have the full authority to initiate and implement policies that intend to limit air pollution. Their complete awareness of air pollution can result in conducting certain protocols to approve new policies and legislations that can improve the air quality in Jordan. Unfortunately, no previous studies were conducted to analyze policymakers' knowledge regarding air pollution in Jordan, and this study's results hoped to reflect the importance of air pollutants and their greater significance on public health.;"air pollution; COPD; knowledge; policymakers; middle east";"carbon monoxide; air pollution; air quality; Article; awareness; chronic obstructive lung disease; environmental exposure; environmental protection; health care policy; human; interview; knowledge; particulate matter; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; public health; questionnaire; respiratory tract disease";;1;0;0;0;0;1;Andina
500;Air Pollution and Climate Change Risk Perception among Residents in Three Cities of the Mexico Megalopolis;"Landeros-Mugica, K; Urbina-Soria, J; Angeles-Hernandez, DI; Gutierrez-Arzaluz, M; Mugica-alvarez, V; Cheng, YH";Recent reports of the criteria pollutants in the Megalopolis, located in the central part of Mexico, consistently show air quality standard exceedances in most of the cities that make it up, since it is a large concentration where approximately 17% of the national population resides and because it has significant commercial and industrial development. To investigate the similarities and disparities in risk perception concerning air pollution and climate change among residents living in Central Mexico, a cross-sectional survey study was carried out within three metropolitan areas encompassed by the Megalopolis. A total of 1750 questionnaire surveys were conducted across 21 municipalities within the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA), 16 municipalities within the Toluca Valley Metropolitan Area (TVMA), and 8 municipalities within the Cuernavaca Metropolitan Area. The three metropolitan areas showed significant differences in terms of air quality perception, risk perception, attitudes, and causal attribution perception, but health-related perception did not have significant differences among the areas. The MCMA exhibited higher knowledge about air pollution, although it associated the causes with urban activities such as car usage, while the Toluca and Cuernavaca areas linked this issue to the burning of garbage, coal, wood, and agricultural activities. Although residents expressed concern about air pollution, climate change, and their effects, they do not know how to act to contribute to the solution.;"risk perception; air pollution; climate change; attitudes; causal attributions";"Mexico [Mexico (NTN)]; Mexico [North America]; Toluca Valley; Air quality; Health risks; Risk perception; Technology transfer; Attitude; Causal attributions; Central Mexico; Climate change risks; Commercial development; Cross-sectional surveys; Industrial development; Me-xico; Metropolitan area; Mexico City metropolitan areas; air quality; atmospheric pollution; climate change; industrial development; metropolitan area; risk perception; Climate change";"SOCIAL-SCIENCE; MITIGATION; BEHAVIORS; KNOWLEDGE";1;1;0;1;0;1;Andina
528;The Theory of Planned Behavior to Predict Protective Behavioral Intentions against PM2.5 in Parents of Young Children from Urban and Rural Beijing, China;"Liu, SM; Chiang, YT; Tseng, CC; Ng, E; Yeh, GL; Fang, WT";Smog and air pollution have fast become significant environmental problems and are attributed to rapid global industrialization and urbanization. Emissions of fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) increase smog and air pollution, with strong impacts on human health. Children are particularly vulnerable. While increasing studies are being conducted on the behaviors leading to PM2.5 toxicity from the perspective of environmental toxicants, there is a lack of research on factors influencing anti-PM2.5 behavioral intentions. Thus, this study aims to narrow this gap by adapting the theory of planned behavior framework to investigate the effects of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control on protective behavioral intentions against PM2.5. In total, 1277 online questionnaires were collected from parents of young children living in urban and rural areas of Beijing, and the data was analyzed using correlation, regression, and path analyses. Results revealed that there were significant differences between parents from urban and rural areas in terms of attitude (t = 4.727 > 1.96, p < 0.001), subjective norms (t = 5.529 > 1.96, p < 0.001), perceived behavioral control (t = 6.155 > 1.96, p < 0.001), and anti-PM2.5 behavioral intentions (t = 6.838 > 1.96, p < 0.001). Path analysis revealed that parents from urban and rural areas had different behavioral intention paths. For urban parents, the findings indicated that subjective norms (beta = 0.73, t = 21.84 > 3.29) and perceived behavioral control (gamma = 0.22, t = 6.12 > 3.29) had direct impacts on anti-PM2.5 behavioral intentions. In contrast, the attitudes (gamma = 0.39, t = 3.74 > 3.29) and subjective norms (beta = 0.60, t = 8.55 > 3.29) of rural parents were found to directly influence anti-PM2.5 behavioral intentions.;"theory of planned behavior; anti-PM2.5 behavioral intention; young children's parents; rural and urban areas";"Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Attitude; Beijing; Child; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Intention; Male; Parents; Particulate Matter; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban Population; Urbanization; Beijing [China]; China; atmospheric pollution; behavioral response; child health; geodynamics; health risk; particulate matter; prediction; questionnaire survey; rural area; theoretical study; urban area; article; child; China; clinical article; female; human; male; path analysis; questionnaire; remission; rural area; Theory of Planned Behavior; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; attitude; behavior; child parent relation; China; health behavior; particulate matter; psychology; rural population; urban population; urbanization";"PARTICULATE MATTER PM2.5; SUBJECTIVE NORM; AIR-POLLUTION; FINE PARTICULATE; EXTENDED THEORY; RESPIRATORY-DISEASES; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; REASONED ACTION; RIVER DELTA; HEALTH";1;1;0;0;0;1;Andina
531;Public perception of haze weather based on Weibo comments;"Zhang Q.; Chen J.; Liu X.";In China, haze weather has become a major public concern and is frantically discussed by the public. Many people express their views, opinions, or complaints on social media. Effectively extracting this useful information may help to improve our understanding of how the public perceive and respond to haze, and could potentially contribute to environmental policy-making. In this paper, we study how the public perceive haze during haze weather and how this perception changes with seasons based on comment data from a major social media platform in China, Weibo, and using several social network methods, including perceptual keyword cloud mapping, complex network topology characteristics, and social perception analysis. The results showed that the publics perception was focused on the causes of haze in spring, enjoyment of life and travel in summer, measures to prevent haze in autumn, and the adverse effects of haze on human health in winter. © 2019 by the authors.

594;Air Quality, Pollution Perception, and Residents' Health: Evidence from China;"Zhu, J; Lu, CT";Environmental and resident health issues associated with air pollution are an area of growing concern for both policy officials and the general public. In recent years, China has been accelerating the construction of a Beautiful China and a Healthy China, with the aim of protecting and improving the environment and ensuring public health. In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of air quality and air pollution perception on residents' health. This study used the 2017 Chinese General Social Survey data to measure self-rated health, mental health, and air pollution perception. Using matched socioeconomic indicators and air pollution data, we analyzed the relationship between subjective perception of air pollution, objective air pollution data, and residents' health. The results showed the following: (1) Air pollution perception has a significant negative impact on self-rated health and mental health. Thus, it needs more consideration to reduce environmental health risks. (2) Objective air pollution has a significant negative impact on mental health. At the same time, its effect on self-rated health was insignificant. These results provide empirical evidence supporting the Chinese government's decision to invest more in combating air pollution and ensuring the health of Chinese residents.;"health; air pollution; pollution perception";"adult; air pollution; air quality; article; China; Chinese; controlled study; environmental health; female; government; human; human experiment; male; mental health; perception; resident";"SELF-RATED HEALTH; LIFE SATISFACTION; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY; OF-LIFE; INEQUALITIES; MORTALITY; IMPACT; URBAN; HAPPINESS";1;0;0;1;0;1;Andina
613;Factors influencing protective behaviours during haze episodes in Singapore: A population-based study;"Ng, KYY; Yeung, W; Sou, KL; Lim, JX; Liang, S; Lee, RKJ; Fong, NJM; Lua, A; Look, X; Ann-Lee, J; Leong, YH; Chong, C; Ang, KY; Lie, C; Chin, A; Sng, JGK; Tai, BC";Introduction: Haze is a recurrent problem in Southeast Asia. Exposure to haze is linked to ophthalmic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and mortality. In this study, we investigated the role of demographic factors, knowledge and perceived risk in influencing protective behaviours during the 2013 haze in Singapore. Methods: We evaluated 696 adults in a cross-sectional study. Participants were sampled via a 2-stage simple random sampling without replacement from a large residential district in Singapore in 2015. The questionnaire measured the participant's knowledge, perceived risk and behaviours during the Southeast Asian haze crisis in 2013. Reliability and validity of the questionnaire were assessed using comparative fit index (>= 0.96) and root mean square error of approximation (<= 0.05). We performed structural equation modelling to examine the relationship between the hypothesised factors and protective behaviours. Results: More than 95% of the individuals engaged in at least 1 form of protective behaviour. Knowledge was strongly associated with protective behaviours via direct effect (beta=0.45, 95% CI 0.19-0.69, P<0.001) and indirect effect through perceived risk (beta=0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.31, P= 0.002). Perceived risk was associated with protective behaviours (beta=0.28, 95% CI:0.11-0.44, P=0.002). A lower household income and ethnic minority were associated with protective behaviours. A lower education level and smokers were associated with lower knowledge of haze. A higher education and ethnic minority were associated with a lower perceived risk. Wearing of N95 masks was associated with other haze-related protective behaviours (beta= 0.24, 95% CI 0.08-0.37, P=0.001). Conclusion: Knowledge was associated with protective behaviours, suggesting the importance of public education. Efforts should target those of lower education level and smokers. The wearing of N95 masks correlates with uptake of other protective behaviours.;"Haze; knowledge; N95 mask; protective behaviour; risk perception";"Adult; Asia, Southeastern; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnic Groups; Humans; Minority Groups; Reproducibility of Results; Singapore; adult; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; ethnic group; human; minority group; reproducibility; Singapore; Southeast Asia";"AIR-POLLUTION; RISK PERCEPTIONS; HEALTH; MORTALITY; FIRES";1;1;0;0;0;1;Andina
636;Assessment of Auto-rickshaw Drivers Knowledge Regarding the Effects of Air Pollution on Health and Its Prevention;"Dhanvijay, R; Pohekar, S";Background: Air pollution is the major environmental pollution that contains different types of gases, dust particles, small molecules, etc. Air pollution is mainly caused by smoke or other harmful gases, such as oxides of carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen. Auto-rickshaw drivers are not only affected by air pollution, they are exposed to climatic changes, and. poor road conditions. They are exposed to air pollution, dust, infected droplets, job insecurity, noise pollution and vibration, business demands, damage to their vehicles, and, schedule-related pressure. Drivers also have the responsibility of their passengers and pedestrians-'lives and other vehicles. The objective of the study is to analyze knowledge among auto-rickshaw drivers regarding the health effects of air pollution and its prevention. Methods: An observational research methodology, a cross-sectional research design was used to perform this analysis. Probability purposive sampling technique was used to collect data from auto rickshaw drivers based on the health effects of air pollution and its prevention utilizing structured questionnaires. The sample attributes have been defined by frequency, percentage, after data collection. The Chi-square test was also used to figure out the correlation between knowledge and specified demographic variables. Results: The findings show that 1.67% of auto-rickshaw drivers had an average level of knowledge score, 38.33% of them were having good and 60 % of them were having an excellent level of knowledge score and none of them were found to have a very poor level of knowledge. The minimum knowledge score was 7 and the maximum knowledge score was 14. Hence it indicates that auto-rickshaw drivers have good knowledge about the effect of air pollution and their prevention. Conclusions: The study shows that the auto-rickshaw drivers having good knowledge about air pollution to the management of respiratory diseases and along with their complications as well as to take the required measures to avoid respiratory complications.;"Effects; air pollution; prevention; auto-rickshaw drivers";;;1;1;0;1;0;1;Andina

121;Social acceptance towards the air pollution in China: Evidence from public's willingness to pay for smog mitigation;"Sun, CW; Yuan, X; Yao, X";Air pollution is one of the most predominant challenges in China. In order to ensure the smog governance projects could be promoted smoothly and the public shoulder the environmental responsibilities consciously, it is necessary for the policymakers to take public attitude into consideration, and understand the public willingness to pay (WTP) for smog mitigation. This paper adopts a CV method framework to assess the value of WTP and analyze the determinants. Given the consideration of the possible presence of the selectivity bias caused by protest responses, the bivariate sample selection model is constructed for estimation. Results show that up to 14% of respondents hold the protest responses, and neglecting the selection bias caused by protest responses would lead to downward biased estimates. The mean value of WTP for the smog mitigation is 1590.36 RMB per year, accounting for about 1% of annual income. Moreover, the NIMBY (not in my backyard) attitude among public is found to be significantly correlated with their WTP, and the other determinants such as household annual income, energy expenditure and economic loss caused by smog could also substantially affect the value of WTP. We further recommend grading governance and policy transparency to address the smog crisis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

122;Does public opinion affect air quality? Evidence based on the monthly data of 109 prefecture-level cities in China;"Zhang, SL; Li, Y; Hao, Y; Zhang, YP";In recent years, serious smog and haze have shrouded vast areas of northern and eastern China, which has drawn broad attention at home and abroad. Although China is an authoritarian country with strict media control, public opinion may still affect air quality by putting pressure on the local and central governments to enhance environmental protections. In this paper, the impact of public opinion on air quality in China is for the first time quantitatively examined. Specifically, the monthly average levels of the Air Quality Index (AQI) and the concentrations of several main air pollutants, such as PM2.5, PM10 and SO2, are utilized as indicators for air quality. Using a dataset consisting of 109 prefecture-level Chinese cities for the period between November 2013 and October 2016, the estimation results indicate that air pollution significantly affects public opinion on air quality, and the surge in public opinion on air pollution occurs more frequently in the winter. Public opinion seems to have a positive effect on the environment only in the short run: air quality tends to improve two months after the surge in negative public opinion. In general, public opinion about air pollution helps to improve air quality in China.;"Public opinion; Air quality; Prefecture-level cities; China";"China; Air pollution; Air quality; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Air pollutants; Air quality indices; Central government; China; Estimation results; Evidence-based; Prefecture-level cities; Public opinions; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); environmental protection; estimation method; governance approach; haze; smog; Social aspects";"WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; POLLUTION; PM2.5; MEDIA; COMMUNICATION; CENSORSHIP; EXPOSURE; IMPACT; GROWTH";1;0;0;0;0;1;Ella
129;Integrating travel behavior with land use regression to estimate dynamic air pollution exposure in Hong Kong;"Tang, R; Tian, LW; Thach, TQ; Tsui, TH; Brauer, M; Lee, M; Allen, R; Yuchi, W; Lai, PC; Wong, P; Barratt, B";Background: Epidemiological studies typically use subjects' residential address to estimate individuals' air pollution exposure. However, in reality this exposure is rarely static as people move from home to work/study locations and commute during the day. Integrating mobility and time-activity data may reduce errors and biases, thereby improving estimates of health risks. Objectives: To incorporate land use regression with movement and building infiltration data to estimate time-weighted air pollution exposures stratified by age, sex, and employment status for population subgroups in Hong Kong. Methods: A large population-representative survey (N = 89,385) was used to characterize travel behavior, and derive time-activity pattern for each subject. Infiltration factors calculated from indoor/outdoor monitoring campaigns were used to estimate micro-environmental concentrations. We evaluated dynamic and static (residential location-only) exposures in a staged modeling approach to quantify effects of each component. Results: Higher levels of exposures were found for working adults and students due to increased mobility. Compared to subjects aged 65 or older, exposures to PM2.5, BC, and NO2 were 13%, 39% and 14% higher, respectively for subjects aged below 18, and 3%, 18% and 11% higher, respectively for working adults. Exposures of females were approximately 4% lower than those of males. Dynamic exposures were around 20% lower than ambient exposures at residential addresses. Conclusions: The incorporation of infiltration and mobility increased heterogeneity in population exposure and allowed identification of highly exposed groups. The use of ambient concentrations may lead to exposure misclassification which introduces bias, resulting in lower effect estimates than 'true' exposures.;"Air pollution; Dynamic exposure; Land use regression; Exposure assessment; Travel behavior; Time-activity";"Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Travel; China; Hong Kong; Air pollution; Health risks; Housing; Population statistics; Air pollution exposures; Dynamic exposure; Environmental concentration; Epidemiological studies; Exposure assessment; Exposure misclassification; Land use regression; Travel behaviors; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; estimation method; health risk; land use; pollution exposure; survey; travel behavior; adult; age; aged; air monitoring; air pollution; ambient air; Article; building; employment status; environmental exposure; female; Hong Kong; human; land use; male; particulate matter; population research; priority journal; residential area; sex; sex difference; travel; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; middle aged; statistics and numerical data; Land use";"PERSONAL EXPOSURE; PARTICULATE MATTER; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; HEALTH IMPACT; OUTDOOR; POLLUTANTS; AMBIENT; PM2.5; INDOOR; HETEROGENEITY";0;0;0;1;0;0;Ella
167;The public perceptions and willingness to pay: from the perspective of the smog crisis in China;"Sun, CW; Yuan, X; Xu, ML";The deteriorating air quality, which is linked to human actions related to energy resources, has become an urgent global problem. China's air pollution has reached the hazardous level since 2000s. In consideration of the serious health and social problems, residential demand for clean air is increasing. This paper applies the Contingent Valuation method to estimate public's willingness to pay (WTP) for reducing air pollution in the urban area of China. Open-ended scenarios through face-to-face surveys are used to elicit public's WTP. The Two-Part model is employed for the estimation: the probit model is used to estimate the probability of respondents who have positive WTP values, and the interval regression model is employed to estimate the specific WTP level of those with nonzero WTP values. The results show that nearly 90% of the respondents are willing to pay for reducing air pollution, and the average amount of WTP per individual is 382.6RMB per year. Household income is found to be positively correlated with people's WTP, and those who trust the government are more willing to share the cost of reducing air pollution. This study recommends designing some effective mechanisms to tap the potentially available source of money for smog mitigation and improving the transparency of smog governance to enhance the government credibility as solutions to cope with smog crisis.

171;Air quality, human behavior and urban park visit: A case study in Beijing;"Jiang, YQ; Huang, GL; Fisher, B";Parks provide critical ecosystem services to urban residents. Many of these services can only be realized when people visit parks. Particulate matter exposure poses negative health impacts and may turn the health benefits brought by park visits into health risks. This tradeoff relationship is heavily moderated by how individuals behave under varying ambient air quality conditions. While there is a growing evidence base regarding the benefits brought by urban parks, little is known about how people adjust their park visitation to air pollution. Here we use two approaches to understand if air quality affects urban park visits in Beijing: a stated preference survey on social media and a year-long faceto-face survey in a neighborhood park. Quantile regression and ANOVA analysis were used. We found particulate pollution has a negative impact on the maximum number of visits a park may receive. A significant drop occurred when the pollution level changed from moderate to heavy pollution. Therefore, the ecosystem services provided by parks are not fully realized due to the reduced number of visits caused by air pollution. Second, regardless of how poor air quality is, a proportion of people (41-64%) put themselves at exposure risk to enjoy the benefits brought by parks. Third, the inconsistency between behavior and intention signals people are less protected from the potential adverse health impacts of poor air quality than they think. Future study should look into what factors may cause the divergence between people's intentions and behaviors. Understandings on this issue will contribute to design better guidance and incentives to reduce the adverse health cost of air pollution exposure from park visitation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

190;The role of personal air pollution sensors and smartphone technology in changing travel behaviour;"Haddad, H; de Nazelle, A";Exposure to air pollution is affected by human behaviour, and has consequences for individual and collective health. One way to lessen the health effects of air pollution is to change personal travel behaviour with the help of new information, communication and sensing technologies. Our social research tracked the experiences of participants, air quality and technology enthusiasts, based in London who financially contributed to participate in an early-stage technical trial of a new air pollution sensor and app providing individuals with air pollution information (specifically levels of NO2 and VOCs). This paper reports the results of a before and after survey (returning respondents n=22) and 12 in-depth interviews with individuals who took part in the beta test of the sensor and phone app. The survey results show that travel-related behaviours and attitudes relevant to air pollution did not change after using the technology. In contrast, expectations of technology performance and the extent it would influence behaviours were significantly lower after the trial than before. Further exploration during semi-structured interviews found that the participants, given their already high level of engagement with the topic, felt the capacity for immediate individual behaviour change was limited. As well as time and practical constraints, most people in this sample felt they were already doing what they could to avoid high levels of air pollution in their daily lives. Despite this, they had some recommendations to improve the app, such as the inclusion of real-time and historic maps, and the ability to make self and other comparisons. Overwhelmingly, people saw a broader role for the technology to engage the public with air pollution through raising awareness, and harnessing citizen science to collect diverse reliable data to inform policy and influence local policymakers to reduce air pollution levels.;;;"PLANNED BEHAVIOR; CITIZEN SCIENCE; SELF-IDENTITY; CONSERVATION; MODELS; IMPACT; TOOL";1;1;0;0;0;1;Ella
226;Inverted quarantine in the face of environmental change: Initiative defensive behaviors against air pollution in China;"Liu, WL; Du, CY; Chu, XP; Wang, ZH";People in China have become concerned with the health threats associated with severe air pollution. As a result, behavioural adjustments and pollutant filtration product implementation have become common means for people to cope with pollution threats in their daily lives. However, a systematic awareness of the basic characteristics and mechanisms of such behaviours is lacking. This paper focuses on how residents engage in inverted quarantine in response to air pollution. We examine in detail their behavioural responses by conducting a questionnaire survey. Results show that individual avoidance behaviours are quite diverse and combined. Masks have been identified as the most widely adopted filtration product with the lowest input costs. High-income groups have a higher tendency to purchase expensive filtering devices compared with low-income groups and prefer to combine multiple protection strategies. In addition to the driving effect of income, individual psychological perception plays an important role in the decision making of households. A lower public confidence in the government further encourages individual self-protection. These findings urge the government to enhance their air pollution control efforts and their timeliness of disclosing pollution information. The significant driving effects of individual cognition factors also call for a proper guidance to achieve a rational public perception of air pollution. Although the health benefits of using pollutant filtering devices have been widely discussed and proven, the increased energy consumption and other environmental impacts resulting from the use of such products are easily neglected. It demands the implementation of stricter market entrance, improved energy efficiency standards and enhanced waste management. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

240;Perceptions of Quality of Life and Pollution among China's Urban Middle Class: The Case of Smog in Tangshan;"Li, XY; Tilt, B";"After decades of rapid economic development, China is facing severe environmental problems. In particular, smog in urban areas has recently attracted a great deal of scientific and media attention both domestically and internationally. Our focus in this article is on public perceptions of smog in the northern city of Tangshan, which is routinely ranked as one of the urban areas with the worst air quality in the nation. In this article, we present the results of qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys with 341 urban residents. We examine how these residents perceive and weigh the importance of various aspects related to quality of life, including their experience with air pollution. Study participants considered environmental quality an issue of lower priority than many others; however, they surprisingly ranked it over economic concerns such as jobs and income. Their responses suggest that, for many urban residents, environmental problems like smog are fundamentally linked to basic quality of life concerns such as physical health and family well-being. We interpret our findings in the context of literature on the rise of China's middle class, the rise of environmental consciousness, and the role of gender in mediating perceptions of pollution and family health.

290;Traffic-related air pollution and perceived health risk: Lay assessment of an everyday hazard;Day, RJ;This article examines the perceived risks to health from traffic-related air pollution among residents of four neighbourhoods in a borough of north London. Drawing on interview and survey data, the first part of the discussion presents views on possible health effects in general terms, and perceived effects on respondents themselves and their families. Respiratory and allergic conditions were found to feature most consistently, while increased heart morbidity was associated with greater uncertainty. The article goes on to reflect on the epistemological processes underlying these beliefs, concluding that although these lay beliefs largely parallel current scientific understanding, there is an inherent tension between epistemological loyalties that will be important for those working with environmental health risks to understand.;"risk; lay knowledge; lay epidemiology; air pollution; health; environment";"air pollution; allergic disease; article; environmental exposure; environmental health; epistemology; exhaust gas; hazard assessment; health hazard; health survey; interview; morbidity; respiratory tract disease; United Kingdom";"ENVIRONMENTAL RISK; POPULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; URBAN; QUALITY; PERCEPTIONS; EXPERTISE";0;0;0;1;0;1;Ella
305;Singapore's willingness to pay for mitigation of transboundary forest-fire haze from Indonesia;"Lin, Y; Wijedasa, LS; Chisholm, RA";Haze pollution over the past four decades in Southeast Asia is mainly a result of forest and peatland fires in Indonesia. The economic impacts of haze include adverse health effects and disruption to transport and tourism. Previous studies have used a variety of approaches to assess the economic impacts of haze and the forest fires more generally. But no study has used contingent valuation to assess non-market impacts of haze on individuals. Here we apply contingent valuation to estimate impacts of haze on Singapore, one of most severely affected countries. We used a double-bounded dichotomous-choice survey design and the Kaplan-Meier-Turnbull method to infer the distribution of Singaporeans' willingness to pay (WTP) for haze mitigation. Our estimate of mean individual WTP was 0.97% of annual income (n = 390). To calculate total national WTP, we stratified by income, the demographic variable most strongly related to individual WTP. The total WTP estimate was $643.5 million per year (95% CI [$527.7 million, $765.0 million]). This estimate is comparable in magnitude to previously estimated impacts of Indonesia's fires and also to the estimated costs of peatland protection and restoration. We recommend that our results be incorporated into future cost-benefit analyses of the fires and mitigation strategies.;"willingness to pay; haze; Indonesian forest fires; peatlands; contingent valuation";"Indonesia; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Deforestation; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Fire hazards; Fires; Resource valuation; Wetlands; Contingent valuations; Forest fires; haze; Peat land; Willingness to pay; contingent valuation; cost analysis; cost-benefit analysis; economic impact; environmental economics; environmental protection; forest fire; haze; peatland; survey design; transboundary pollution; willingness to pay; Cost benefit analysis";"CENTRAL KALIMANTAN; AIR-POLLUTION; SOUTHEAST-ASIA; PEAT FIRES; SMOKE HAZE; QUALITY; MORTALITY";0;0;1;0;0;1;Ella
325;Adoption of Protective Behaviours: Residents Response to City Smog in Hefei, China;"Cheng, P; Wei, JC; Marinova, D; Guo, XM";City smog outbreaks in many Chinese cities aroused public concern about health risks and environmental pollution in China. This study investigates protective behaviours of the citizens in response to city smog using protective action decision to understand their actions. A survey was conducted in Hefei, Anhui in 2015, after the city experienced severe smog events. The data from 429 respondents supported the developed model. Hazard-related attributes were the strongest predictors for willingness to adopt protective behaviours. Public risk perception only positively affected self-protective actions. Information sources affected risk perception and increased the respondents' self-protective intentions. Older adults and respondents with lower educational levels were more likely to adopt environmentally friendly actions. The findings' theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.;;"Anhui; China; Hefei; action plan; decision making; environmental management; hazard assessment; health risk; public health; risk perception; smog";"PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR; SOCIAL AMPLIFICATION; RISK PERCEPTIONS; HAZARD; DETERMINANTS; ADJUSTMENT; INTERNET; VALUES";0;1;0;0;0;1;Ella
356;Designing a comprehensive behaviour change intervention to promote and monitor exclusive use of liquefied petroleum gas stoves for the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial;"Williams K.N.; Thompson L.M.; Sakas Z.; Hengstermann M.; Quinn A.; Diáz-Artiga A.; Thangavel G.; Puzzolo E.; Rosa G.; Balakrishnan K.; Peel J.; Checkley W.; Clasen T.F.; Miranda J.J.; Rosenthal J.P.; Harvey S.A.";Introduction Increasing use of cleaner fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and abandonment of solid fuels is key to reducing household air pollution and realising potential health improvements in low-income countries. However, achieving exclusive LPG use in households unaccustomed to this type of fuel, used in combination with a new stove technology, requires substantial behaviour change. We conducted theory-grounded formative research to identify contextual factors influencing cooking fuel choice to guide the development of behavioural strategies for the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial. The HAPIN trial will assess the impact of exclusive LPG use on air pollution exposure and health of pregnant women, older adult women, and infants under 1 year of age in Guatemala, India, Peru, and Rwanda. Methods Using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) framework and Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) to guide formative research, we conducted in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, observations, key informant interviews and pilot studies to identify key influencers of cooking behaviours in the four countries. We used these findings to develop behavioural strategies likely to achieve exclusive LPG use in the HAPIN trial. Results We identified nine potential influencers of exclusive LPG use, including perceived disadvantages of solid fuels, family preferences, cookware, traditional foods, non-food-related cooking, heating needs, LPG awareness, safety and cost and availability of fuel. Mapping formative findings onto the theoretical frameworks, behavioural strategies for achieving exclusive LPG use in each research site included free fuel deliveries, locally acceptable stoves and equipment, hands-on training and printed materials and videos emphasising relevant messages. In the HAPIN trial, we will monitor and reinforce exclusive LPG use through temperature data loggers, LPG fuel delivery tracking, in-home observations and behavioural reinforcement visits. Conclusion Our formative research and behavioural strategies can inform the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of theory-informed strategies to promote exclusive LPG use in future stove programmes and research studies. © 2020 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

379;Perception of air quality and the thermal environment in offices;"Butala, V; Muhic, S";People's perception of the thermal environment and the quality of air in mechanically and naturally ventilated office environments is discussed. Interdisciplinary research of the indoor environment (technical and medical fields) was based on the simultaneous measurement of the thermal environment parameters, as well on as on surveying employees during their normal working activities. The survey sought to determine the health status and health problems of those surveyed in the 6 months prior to the study, as well as the current state of health and current subjective evaluation of the thermal environment and air quality. Deviations between the measured values evaluated by predicted mean vote (PMV) - predicted percent of dissatisfied (PPD) model (PMV-PDD) and the subjective evaluations of thermal environment of those surveyed were found. The subjectively stated reasons for the health problems of employees gave precedence to natural, as opposed to mechanical, ventilation, which is confirmed by the average absence from work for health reasons. An index of health was defined and analyzed for the people within a building. Significant correlations between indoor air parameters and the way people felt were found. Findings from the study indicate a significant role for the psychological factors and psychological state of the respondents when subjectively describing the indoor environment.;"thermal environment; perceived air quality; health index; symptom prevalence; well-being; air conditioning; natural ventilation";"carbon dioxide; volatile organic compound; absenteeism; adult; air conditioning; air quality; ambient air; article; building; environmental temperature; female; health status; health survey; human; humidity; male; occupational health; prediction; priority journal; psychological aspect";"SICK-BUILDING-SYNDROME; SYNDROME SBS; COMFORT; WORKERS";0;0;0;1;0;0;Ella
518;Factors affecting parents perception on air quality-from the individual to the community level;"Guo Y.; Liu F.; Lu Y.; Mao Z.; Lu H.; Wu Y.; Chu Y.; Yu L.; Liu Y.; Ren M.; Li N.; Chen X.; Xiang H.";"The perception of air quality significantly affects the acceptance of the public of the governments environmental policies. The aim of this research is to explore the relationship between the perception of the air quality of parents and scientific monitoring data and to analyze the factors that affect parents perceptions. Scientific data of air quality were obtained from Wuhans environmental condition reports. One thousand parents were investigated for their knowledge and perception of air quality. Scientific data show that the air quality of Wuhan follows an improving trend in general, while most participants believed that the air quality of Wuhan has deteriorated, which indicates a significant difference between public perception and reality. On the individual level, respondents with an age of 40 or above (40 or above: OR = 3.252; 95% CI: 1.170-9.040), a higher educational level (college and above: OR = 7.598; 95% CI: 2.244-25.732) or children with poor healthy conditions (poor: OR = 6.864; 95% CI: 2.212-21.302) have much more negative perception of air quality. On the community level, industrial facilities, vehicles and city construction have major effects on parents perception of air quality.

580;Perception of Risks from Wood Combustion and Traffic Induced Air Pollution: Evidence from Northern Europe;"Orru, K; Tiittanen, P; Ung-Lanki, S; Orru, H; Lanki, T";The health effects of particulate matter, increasing emissions from transportation and requisites for making use of biofuels brings up the need to understand how individuals interpret air-pollution-related risks from wood burning and traffic. We aim to clarify the extent to which perceived risks from road-traffic and wood-smoke can be explained by the individual psychological, social status-related and socio-institutional factors in the case of two Northern European countries, Finland and Estonia. This approach elucidates which of the closely intertwined factors shape the perception of risks from air pollution in different socio-institutional contexts and for different air pollution sources. The study uses data from cross-sectional population surveys conducted among 1112 Finnish and 1000 Estonian residents about environmental health risk perception and coping. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that in both countries' cases, the perceived personal and general risk from traffic exhaust and wood-smoke can be explained by the perception of exposure to pollution and, also, by the level of knowledge of, the worry about and the possible symptoms from environmental health factors. The perceived vulnerability due to poor health further sensitises individuals towards risks from air pollution. Higher trust towards state institutions in guaranteeing a healthy living environment and greater perceived openness about the risks may attenuate the feelings of vulnerability to air pollution risks in Finland compared to Estonia. The ingrained appeal for wood burning may explain the higher acceptance of exhausts from wood-burning compared to traffic. This may lead to scant support for measures to reduce emissions from wood combustion.;"perceived risk; traffic exhaust; wood-smoke; cardio-vascular disease; Northern Europe";"Air; Estonia; Europe; Finland; Niger [West Africa]; Northern Europe; regression analysis";"ENVIRONMENTAL RISK; HEALTH; QUALITY; ANNOYANCE; EXPERIENCE; ESTONIA; IMPACT";1;0;0;1;0;1;Ella
609;A cross-sectional study on determinants of indoor air pollution and its perceived impact among the residents of urban field practice area of AMCH, Salem, Tamil Nadu;"Priyadarsini, SP; Ibrahim, RM; Somasundaram, VM; Nayeem, RA; Balasubramanian, R";Background: Over the past 20 years. indoor air pollution (IAP) has received much attention as the quality of the indoor air is affected a lot. IAP means the presence of substances which are redundant in the indoor air at concentrations toxic to health. Very few studies have addressed the determinants of indoor air pollutants in places like urban slum areas in Tamil Nadu. To reduce this research gap, this study has been undertaken. Aim: To study the determinants of IAP and its perceived impact on health. Settings and Design: This was a community-based cross-sectional study. Complete information from 440 households consisting of 1606 individuals was collected through a semi-structured questionnaire. Materials and Methods: Residents of an urban field practice area of Annapoorana Medical College and Hospitals (AMCH) were the study participants. The study period was from April 19 to March 2020. The study area was an urban field practice area around Department of Community Medicine, Karungalpatty, AMCH. Frequency, proportions. and Spearman test were used to find out the significance between various household environmental conditions and the respiratory diseases using Epi Info software. Results: Results showed that 52.3% of the participants were using incense sticks at home in the evening during pooja and 17.7% of the houses were using mosquito coil in the evening and at night. Also, 29.5% houses reported overcrowding and 66.4% of the houses were not having chimney or exhaust. Results also showed that 71.4% households were practicing opening their windows while cooking. One hundred and fifty-two (34.5%) female respondents had perceived the symptoms like dizziness (12.3%), eye irritation (10.2%), difficulty in breathing (4.5%), dry cough (3.06%), running nose (1.4%), and nasal congestion (1.1%) due to IAP.

Exposure to haze is linked to ophthalmic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and mortality. In this study, we investigated the role of demographic factors, knowledge and perceived risk in influencing protective behaviours during the 2013 haze in Singapore. Methods: We evaluated 696 adults in a cross-sectional study. Participants were sampled via a 2-stage simple random sampling without replacement from a large residential district in Singapore in 2015. The questionnaire measured the participant's knowledge, perceived risk and behaviours during the Southeast Asian haze crisis in 2013. Reliability and validity of the questionnaire were assessed using comparative fit index (>= 0.96) and root mean square error of approximation (<= 0.05). We performed structural equation modelling to examine the relationship between the hypothesised factors and protective behaviours. Results: More than 95% of the individuals engaged in at least 1 form of protective behaviour. Knowledge was strongly associated with protective behaviours via direct effect (beta=0.45, 95% CI 0.19-0.69, P<0.001) and indirect effect through perceived risk (beta=0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.31, P= 0.002). Perceived risk was associated with protective behaviours (beta=0.28, 95% CI:0.11-0.44, P=0.002). A lower household income and ethnic minority were associated with protective behaviours. A lower education level and smokers were associated with lower knowledge of haze. A higher education and ethnic minority were associated with a lower perceived risk. Wearing of N95 masks was associated with other haze-related protective behaviours (beta= 0.24, 95% CI 0.08-0.37, P=0.001). Conclusion: Knowledge was associated with protective behaviours, suggesting the importance of public education. Efforts should target those of lower education level and smokers. The wearing of N95 masks correlates with uptake of other protective behaviours.;"Haze; knowledge; N95 mask; protective behaviour; risk perception";"Adult; Asia, Southeastern; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnic Groups; Humans; Minority Groups; Reproducibility of Results; Singapore; adult; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; ethnic group; human; minority group; reproducibility; Singapore; Southeast Asia";"AIR-POLLUTION; RISK PERCEPTIONS; HEALTH; MORTALITY; FIRES";1;1;0;0;0;1;Ella
636;Assessment of Auto-rickshaw Drivers Knowledge Regarding the Effects of Air Pollution on Health and Its Prevention;"Dhanvijay, R; Pohekar, S";Background: Air pollution is the major environmental pollution that contains different types of gases, dust particles, small molecules, etc. Air pollution is mainly caused by smoke or other harmful gases, such as oxides of carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen. Auto-rickshaw drivers are not only affected by air pollution, they are exposed to climatic changes, and. poor road conditions. They are exposed to air pollution, dust, infected droplets, job insecurity, noise pollution and vibration, business demands, damage to their vehicles, and, schedule-related pressure. Drivers also have the responsibility of their passengers and pedestrians-'lives and other vehicles. The objective of the study is to analyze knowledge among auto-rickshaw drivers regarding the health effects of air pollution and its prevention. Methods: An observational research methodology, a cross-sectional research design was used to perform this analysis. Probability purposive sampling technique was used to collect data from auto rickshaw drivers based on the health effects of air pollution and its prevention utilizing structured questionnaires. The sample attributes have been defined by frequency, percentage, after data collection. The Chi-square test was also used to figure out the correlation between knowledge and specified demographic variables. Results: The findings show that 1.67% of auto-rickshaw drivers had an average level of knowledge score, 38.33% of them were having good and 60 % of them were having an excellent level of knowledge score and none of them were found to have a very poor level of knowledge. The minimum knowledge score was 7 and the maximum knowledge score was 14. Hence it indicates that auto-rickshaw drivers have good knowledge about the effect of air pollution and their prevention. Conclusions: The study shows that the auto-rickshaw drivers having good knowledge about air pollution to the management of respiratory diseases and along with their complications as well as to take the required measures to avoid respiratory complications.;"Effects; air pollution; prevention; auto-rickshaw drivers";;;1;1;0;1;0;1;Ella
659;Environmental conflicts in the South Durban Basin: Integrating residents' perceptions and concerns resulting from air pollution;Jaggernath, J;With a complex mix of large scale industries and major transport networks, the South Durban Basin (SDB) residential area has been subjected to a considerable amount of environmental impacts and conflicts. A major concern in the area is the effects of air pollution on human health and ecology that are caused by the emissions of unacceptable levels of toxins, chemical waste and a large content of sulphur dioxide, which are characteristic of industrial processes and activities. Perceptions regarding environmental conflicts in the area were recorded by eliciting residents' concerns. Fieldwork in the form of questionnaires was undertaken. These were administered to 200 households in Merebank and Wentworth in the SDB to determine residents' knowledge, perceptions and concerns about industrial activities and potential impacts. This paper therefore explores residents' perceptions of environmental impacts and highlights the key issues which contribute to community conflicts - including those conflicts related to government, employment, race and community health.;;;;1;0;0;0;0;1;Ella
158;Air quality change and public perception during the COVID-19 lockdown in India;"Sekar, A; Jasna, RS; Binoy, BV; Mohan, P; Varghese, GK";This study aims at analyzing the change in air quality following the COVID-19 lockdown in India and its perception by the general public. Air quality data for 100 days recorded at 193 stations throughout India were analyzed between 25th March to 17th May 2020. A nationwide online survey was conducted to obtain public perceptions of air quality improvement (n = 1750). On average, approximately 40% improvement in the air quality index was observed, contributed by a reduction in 40% of PM10, 44% of PM2.5, 51% of NO2 and 21% of SO2. There was a significant difference between the levels of all the pollu-tants before and after the lockdown (p < 0.05), except ozone. The correlation between PM10 and PM2.5 with ozone was significant after the lockdown period, indicating that a significant portion of the partic-ulates present in the atmosphere after the lockdown period is secondary. The values of PM2.5/PM10 were found to be >0.5 in North East states and this observation points to the long-distance transport of PM2.5 from other places. The survey for public perception showed that 60% of the respondents perceived improvement in air quality. Household emissions were perceived to be a significant source of pollution after the lockdown. An odds ratio (OR) of 17 (95%, CI: 6.42, 47.04) indicated a very high dependence of perception on actual air quality. OR between air quality and health improvement was 5.2 (95%, CI: 2.69, 10.01), indicating significant health improvement due to air quality improvement. Google Trends analysis showed that media did not influence shaping the perception. There was a significant improve-ment in the actual and perceived air quality in India after the COVID-19-induced lockdown. PM10 levels had the most decisive influence in shaping public perception.(c) 2022 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

269;Determinants of Beijing Residents Intentions to Take Protective Behaviors against Smog: An Application of the Health Belief Model;"Chen Y.; Liu X.";Severe smog, a form of air pollution, has become a threat to public health in Beijing, China. To examine Beijing residents protective behavioral intentions against smog, we proposed a conceptual model, which applies the health belief model (HBM) and specifies the roles of three distal predictors: exposure to news, discussion, and worry. The proposed model was tested in the context of protective behavioral intentions (i.e., intention to wear facemask & intention to use air purifier). Data were collected from Beijing residents during the period from 2/27 to 3/7 in 2017. Structural-equation-modeling (SEM) analyses of valid cases (N = 523) found support for the health belief model regarding the positive effects of perceived threat, perceived benefit, and perceived self-efficacy on intention to wear facemask or intention to use air purifier. Perceived barrier has a negative effect on intention to use air purifier, but is not related to intention to wear facemask. Neither exposure nor discussion is related to perceived threat. The effect of worry on intention to wear facemaskor intention to use air purifier is mediated by perceived threat. This proposed mediating mechanism is superior to the reverse mechanism (that worry mediates perceived threat).

319;Particulate matter source attribution and restaurant mitigation behavioral intentions: an application of attribution theory;"Jang, E; Yoo, JJE; Cho, M";Purpose As commercial cooking is known as a source that generates great concentrations of particulate matter (PM) emissions first accumulating in kitchens before spreading to dining areas, this study aims to explore how to improve restaurants' efforts to reduce PM emissions by the application of attribution theory. Design/methodology/approach Data were obtained from restaurant managers operating their business in South Korea, considered to be qualified to provide accurate information regarding the survey questions. A scenario-based experimental approach was used to test the hypothesized relationships. Cognitive and emotional risk judgements were assessed for its potential interaction effects on the relationships between restaurant perceptions of PM source attributions, preventions attitudes and mitigation behavioral intentions. Findings Results revealed that perceptions of PM main sources were attributed to internal rather than external factors, which improved mitigation behavioral intentions. Such an effect was partially mediated through PM pollution prevention attitudes. Additionally, when applying external source attributions, PM mitigation behavioral intentions were improved by cognitive risk judgements, and PM prevention attitudes were enhanced by affective risk judgements. Research limitations/implications Results assist restaurants to better understand their operations that may be emitting significant levels of PM, thereby encouraging them to set more ambitious and effective PM mitigation operational guidelines for their employees and diners. Originality/value This study provides a fundamental baseline of management perceptions regarding PM emissions related to restaurant mitigation behavioral intentions. Results are useful in designing appropriate communication strategies addressing restaurant PM pollution issues to improve internal restaurant practices regarding clean air quality.;"Attribution theory; Particulate matter; Cognitive and affective risk judgements; Commercial cooking; Mitigation behavioral intentions; Risk attribution";;"RISK PERCEPTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COOKING; POLLUTION; BELIEFS";1;1;0;0;0;1;Ella

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the associations of exposure to traffic-related air pollutants (TRAPs) and noise at school on behavioral development of schoolchildren. METHODS: We evaluated children 7-11 years of age in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) during 2012-2013 within the BREATHE project. Indoor and outdoor concentrations of elemental carbon (EC), black carbon (BC), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were measured at schools in two separate 1-week campaigns. In one campaign we also measured noise levels inside classrooms. Parents filled out the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) to assess child behavioral development, while teachers completed the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder criteria of the DSM-IV (ADHD-DSM- IV) list to assess specific ADHD symptomatology. Negative binomial mixed-effects models were used to estimate associations between the exposures and behavioral development scores. RESULTS: Interquartile range (IQR) increases in indoor and outdoor EC, BC, and NO2 concentrations were positively associated with SDQ total difficulties scores (suggesting more frequent behavioral problems) in adjusted multivariate models, whereas noise was significantly associated with ADHD-DSM-IV scores. CONCLUSION: In our study population of 7-to 11-year-old children residing in Barcelona, exposure to TRAPs at school was associated with increased behavioral problems in schoolchildren. Noise exposure at school was associated with more ADHD symptoms.;;"Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Nitrogen Dioxide; Noise; Particulate Matter; Problem Behavior; Schools; Spain; Vehicle Emissions; black carbon; carbon; nitrogen dioxide; air pollutant; exhaust gas; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; academic achievement; age; air pollution; Article; assessment of humans; attention deficit disorder; child; child behavior; cross-sectional study; disease association; DSM-IV; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; female; gender; human; male; noise; noise pollution; priority journal; problem behavior; school; school child; Spain; Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; symptomatology; vulnerable population; adverse effects; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; chemically induced; exhaust gas; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; toxicity";"DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; USE REGRESSION-MODELS; DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONNAIRE; TRANSPORTATION NOISE; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; ESCAPE PROJECT; AIRCRAFT NOISE; MENTAL-HEALTH; CHILDREN; OUTDOOR";1;0;0;1;0;0;Ella
508;Linking Occupant Behavior and Window Design through Post-Occupancy Evaluation: Enhancing Natural Ventilation and Indoor Air Quality;"Pourtangestani, M; Izadyar, N; Jamei, E; Vrcelj, Z";This study investigates how window design features, such as size, placement, and orientation, might impact occupants' behavior related to natural ventilation in residential houses and how residents manage natural ventilation to affect indoor air quality (IAQ), comfort, and energy efficiency. By analyzing responses from a questionnaire distributed among 200 occupants, this article reveals that stuffy air, perceived outdoor pollutants, odors, and relative humidity, along with factors like inadequate ventilation, temperature fluctuations, and energy consumption concerns, emerge as primary issues affecting occupants' comfort and well-being. This study proposes design recommendations for enhancing IAQ, including optimal window placement for cross-ventilation, window-to-wall ratio (WWR) considerations, and the integration of smart window technologies. This research recognizes that window design is not just a technical matter but involves understanding social and behavioral factors as well. By analyzing occupant responses, it aims to provide insights into the socio-technical parameters that should be considered in window design. The findings offer valuable strategies for architects, designers, and homeowners to optimize natural ventilation and underscore the importance of an occupant-centered approach in sustainable building design.;"indoor air quality (IAQ); natural ventilation; window design; occupants' behavior; occupants' perceptions";"Air quality; Architectural design; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Indoor air pollution; Intelligent buildings; Behavior design; Design features; Indoor air quality; Natural ventilation; Occupant perception; Occupants behaviours; Post occupancy evaluation; Ventilation airs; Window designs; Ventilation";"THERMAL COMFORT; ENERGY PERFORMANCE; BUILDING SHAPE; ZONES";0;0;0;0;0;0;Ella
527;Risk Reduction Behaviors Regarding PM2.5 Exposure among Outdoor Exercisers in the Nanjing Metropolitan Area, China;"Xiong, LL; Li, J; Xia, T; Hu, XY; Wang, Y; Sun, MN; Tang, M";Aims: This study aimed to describe risk reduction behaviors regarding ambient particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 m or less (PM2.5) among outdoor exercisers and to explore potential factors influencing those behaviors in the urban area of Nanjing, China. Method: A cross-sectional convenience sample survey was conducted among 302 outdoor exercisers in May 2015. Descriptive analysis was used to describe demographics, outdoor physical activity patterns, knowledge of PM2.5 and risk reduction behaviors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was then used to explore factors that influence the adoption of risk reduction behaviors. Results: The most common behavior to reduce PM2.5 exposure was minimizing the times for opening windows on hazy days (75.5%), and the least common one was using air purifiers (19.3%). Two thirds of respondents indicated that they wore face masks when going outside in the haze (59.5%), but only 13.6% of them would wear professional antismog face masks. Participants adopting risk reduction behaviors regarding PM2.5 exposure tended to be females, 50-60 year-olds, those with higher levels of knowledge about PM2.5 and those who had children. Conclusions: These findings indicate the importance of improving knowledge about PM2.5 among outdoor exercisers. Educational interventions should also be necessary to guide the public to take appropriate precautionary measures when undertaking outdoor exercise in high PM2.5 pollution areas.;"risk reduction behavior; PM2.5; outdoor exercisers; influencing factors; China";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants; China; Cities; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Exposure; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Risk Reduction Behavior; Urban Health; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; health risk; metropolitan area; multivariate analysis; particulate matter; physical activity; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; regression analysis; risk assessment; urban atmosphere; adult; aged; air pollution; Article; China; convenience sample; cross-sectional study; exercise; female; haze; human; male; middle aged; particulate matter; risk reduction; smog; urban population; air pollutant; analysis; city; environmental exposure; exercise; particle size; particulate matter; physiology; prevention and control; urban health; very elderly";"POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; AIR-POLLUTION; PARTICULATE MATTER; INDIVIDUAL EXPOSURE; HEALTH-RISKS; LUNG-CANCER; MORTALITY; INDOOR; HAZE; ASSOCIATION";1;1;0;0;0;1;Ella
587;An Assessment of the Multidimensional Drivers and Determinants of Public Risk Perception of and Behaviors Related to Exposure to Air Pollution in Serbia;"Stanojevic, G; Malinovic-Milicevic, S; Curcic, NB; Radovanovic, M; Radivojevic, A; Popovic, T; Curcic, S";This study investigates factors contributing to public perception of and behaviors related to air pollution in Serbia. A range of multidimensional indicators, including demographic and socioeconomic features, health status data, and living environment factors, were utilized to evaluate observed awareness and exposure activities. Air pollution is a serious health concern in many areas of Serbia, particularly during the cold season when emissions from the heating sector contribute to high levels of particulate matter. In the period from March to May 2023, a nationwide survey was conducted to gather empirical data and insights that can assist policymakers in the creation of public-health strategies. A set of research questions included the perception of air-pollution impact and citizens' responses to eight pre-defined exposure-reduction activities. Statistical procedures (a chi-square test of independence, a Mann-Whitney U test, and a Kruskal-Wallis H test) were applied to isolate driving factors in the public response to increased air-pollution levels. The findings suggest a gap between risk understanding and risk-reducing behaviors. To address this issue and to ensure that regulations are implemented effectively, it is crucial to prioritize education, develop communication strategies, increase local interventions, and target vulnerable population groups.;"air pollution; multidimensional drivers; public perception; exposure behaviors; Serbia";"Serbia; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; health status; health survey; heating; public attitude; risk perception";"QUALITY; HEALTH; UNDERSTANDINGS";1;1;0;0;0;1;Ella
601;Population's perception on air pollution in Beirut;"Khazen, MA; Adjizian-Gerard, J; Flanquart, H";Studies have shown that the air above Beirut, the Lebanese capital, is polluted. The concentration of NO(2 )and particulate matters are always above the acceptable limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2016, a survey has been done to study the perception of Beirut's population on the air pollution. The survey has shown that the population does perceive the bad quality of the air above the city and its primary source: road traffic. On the other hand, the population perceives the risks related to the security situation as more important than the environmental or traffic related risks. The study has also resulted that individuals perceive that air pollution affects others more then it affects them and a disparity between the different religion denominations regarding the perception of the different risks in general and environmental risks in particular, a point which we cannot explain in this stage.;"Beirut; air pollution; perception; cognitive dissonance; risk";"Beirut [Beyrouth]; Beyrouth; Lebanon; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); nitrogen dioxide; perception; risk assessment; urban area; urban pollution";"EXPOSURE; RISK; LEBANON; SITE";1;0;0;0;1;1;Ella

73;MODIFICATIONS OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR IN RESPONSE TO AIR-POLLUTION NOTIFICATIONS IN COPENHAGEN;"SKOV, T; CORDTZ, T; JENSEN, LK; SAUGMAN, P; SCHMIDT, K; THEILADE, P";Ambient air quality is a major issue today in large cities all over the world. On the theoretical background of the health belief model and the health locus of control model, we studied the knowledge and beliefs about air pollution and the modifications of health behaviour brought about by information to the public about projected levels of air pollution, with special emphasis on reduction of outdoor activity and avoidance of car driving. Data were collected with a questionnaire among a sample of residents in the Copenhagen area. The respondents were almost universally knowledgeable about the prime emission source and concerned about the possible health effects of the air pollution in the area. Avoidance of outdoor activity was associated with personal experiences of symptoms ascribed to the air pollution, employment status, and with female sex, but not with knowledge or beliefs about the degree or health implications of the air pollution. The willingness to avoid car driving was positively associated with the belief that one can oneself influence one's health and with female sex. Lung diseased respondents were generally more prone to protect themselves than the healthy, both by avoiding outdoor activity and by being less willing to avoid car driving. The present study was conducted in an only moderately polluted city, and it is not clear whether the findings and conclusions can be generalized to more polluted cities. The study partly supported the underlying theories of the determinants of health behaviour, but also indicated a need for a broader theoretical framework, incorporating aspects of the respondents' life situation and personal experience which would be relevant to the specific type of health behaviour under study.;"AIR POLLUTION; HEALTH BEHAVIOR; TRAFFIC INTENSITY; MOTOR VEHICLE EXHAUST; OUTDOOR ACTIVITY; HEALTH BELIEF MODEL; HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL";"Adult; Aged; Air Pollution; Automobile Driving; Denmark; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Health Behavior; Human; Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Lung Diseases; Male; Middle Age; Questionnaires; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Vehicle Emissions; Denmark, Copenhagen; air pollution; automobile pollution; health behaviour; outdoor activity; pollution notification; questionnaire data; survey data; theoretical framework; urban area; adult; aged; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; article; behavior; car driving; denmark; experience; health; health status; human; lung disease; major clinical study; motor vehicle; pollution; questionnaire; smog";;0;1;0;1;0;1;Keith
112;The 'advancedness' of knowledge in pollution-saving technological change with a qualitative application to SO2 cap and trade;Grover D.;This paper investigates the extent to which 'advanced' knowledge and technology played a role in the SO2 compliance process in electric power plants under the US SO2 cap and trade program. It investigates the hypothesis that advanced knowledge and technology dedicated to pollution abatement played a minor role in that process while relatively unadvanced forms of knowledge and technology played the main role. New qualitative evidence in this somewhat well-known case is considered: interviews with electric power plant R&D managers, plant-level compliance data, and the changes undergone by boiler manufacturer, coal mining and railroad companies in the supply chain. Advanced knowledge dedicated to pollution abatement like the type now being emphasised for carbon capture and storage (CCS) played a minor role, while unadvanced knowledge and technology played the main role. While there are clearly limits to how far this unadvanced knowledge and technology finding can be generalised to GHG emission control, the specific aspects of the SO2 case that might be broadly informative of the response to GHG emissions are elaborated. In any case, the paper shows how 'innovation' in pollution control can be inexpensive and effective without involving very much advanced knowledge and technology for pollution control. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.;"Air pollution; Innovation; Knowledge; Supply chain; Technological change";"United States; atmospheric pollution; carbon sequestration; ecological economics; greenhouse gas; innovation; knowledge; pollution control; power plant; questionnaire survey; trade-off";;0;0;0;0;0;0;Keith
117;Influence of environmental variables on thermal comfort and air quality perception in office buildings in the humid subtropical climate zone of Brazil;"de Oliveira, CC; Rupp, RF; Ghisi, E";This study evaluates the influence of environmental variables on users' thermal comfort and air quality perception in the humid subtropical climate of Florianopolis, southern Brazil. A building with central air-conditioning system and three mixed-mode buildings, which alternated between natural ventilation and air-conditioning modes, were investigated. Statistical analyses were performed considering environmental data collected in situ between 2014 and 2016 - using microclimate stations, a portable thermo-anemometer and a CO2 analyser - and users' subjective responses obtained by means of an electronic questionnaire. Results showed a direct influence of air temperature and humidity ratio and indirect influence of air movement on thermal comfort. In addition, thermal, air movement and humidity sensation, preference and acceptability affected thermal comfort and air quality perception, highlighting the importance of carrying out a complete assessment of users' perception of the thermal environment. This work supports the use of the ASHRAE 55 adaptive thermal comfort model for mixed-mode buildings under natural ventilation operation. Based on the results obtained in this study, the use of hybrid ventilation strategy is recommended for energy savings due to reducing the use of air-conditioning and improving indoor air quality as there is a decrease in air pollutants level.

131;Exposure and perception of PM2.5 pollution on the mental stress of pregnant women;"Li J.; Huang L.; Han B.; van der Kuijp T.J.; Xia Y.; Chen K.";Prenatal exposure to ambient PM2.5 has been proved to be related to pregnant women's physical health and birth outcomes. However, the damage from air pollution on pregnant women's mental health has not been fully discussed. A case-control study was conducted to evaluate the effects of PM2.5 exposure and risk perception on the mental stress of pregnant women. A total of 605 pregnant women, including 403 high symptoms of stress cases and 202 matched controls, were recruited from January 2018 to December 2018 in Nanjing, among which 313 high symptoms of stress cases and 144 matched controls were included in the analysis. Meaningfully high symptoms of anxiety were defined with a score of 6 points or greater on the phobic anxiety subscale of the Crown-Crisp index. We found that the PM2.5 effect perceived by the case group was significantly higher than the control group, and the PM2.5 exposure of the case group was also significantly higher than that of the control group. Binary logistic regression showed that for each increase in unit of PM2.5 exposure, the risk of pregnant women suffering from high mental stress increased by 13.76% (95 %CI: 8.2619.53%). Through path analysis modeling, we found that in the case group, perceived indoor attributions not only had a direct impact on mental stress (p < 0.001), but also played a key mediating role in the impact of average daily dose of PM2.5 on mental stress (p < 0.001). The high level of mental stress is not only affected by objective exposure, but also by subjective perceptions in the case group. Considering the significant effect of PM2.5 exposure on mental stress, pregnant women are recommended to spend appropriate amounts of time outdoors during clean air days. In addition, the mediating role of risk perception cannot be ignored. It is necessary to reassure pregnant women not to become overly concerned about the risk of PM2.5 pollution and reduce their psychological burden. © 2021 The Authors;"Mental stress; PM<sub>2.5</sub>; Pregnant women; Risk perception";"Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Case-Control Studies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Particulate Matter; Perception; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; Pollution control; Regression analysis; Ambients; Control groups; Matched controls; Mediating roles; Mental health; Mental stress; Physical health; PM$-2.5$; Pregnant woman; Prenatal exposure; mental health; particulate matter; pollution exposure; pregnancy; risk perception; symptom; womens health; adult; air pollution; anxiety; Article; Beck Anxiety Inventory; breathing rate; case control study; confirmatory factor analysis; controlled study; depression; disease simulation; environmental exposure; environmental factor; exploratory factor analysis; female; headache; human; indoor air pollution; interview; job stress; Likert scale; major clinical study; mental health; mental stress; oxidative stress; particulate matter 2.5; path analysis; perception; phobia; physical activity; PM2.5 exposure; pollution; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; questionnaire; risk factor; risk perception; sleep disordered breathing; smoking; work environment; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; particulate matter; perception; pregnant woman; Risk perception";;1;0;0;1;0;1;Keith
158;Air quality change and public perception during the COVID-19 lockdown in India;"Sekar, A; Jasna, RS; Binoy, BV; Mohan, P; Varghese, GK";This study aims at analyzing the change in air quality following the COVID-19 lockdown in India and its perception by the general public. Air quality data for 100 days recorded at 193 stations throughout India were analyzed between 25th March to 17th May 2020. A nationwide online survey was conducted to obtain public perceptions of air quality improvement (n = 1750). On average, approximately 40% improvement in the air quality index was observed, contributed by a reduction in 40% of PM10, 44% of PM2.5, 51% of NO2 and 21% of SO2. There was a significant difference between the levels of all the pollu-tants before and after the lockdown (p < 0.05), except ozone. The correlation between PM10 and PM2.5 with ozone was significant after the lockdown period, indicating that a significant portion of the partic-ulates present in the atmosphere after the lockdown period is secondary. The values of PM2.5/PM10 were found to be >0.5 in North East states and this observation points to the long-distance transport of PM2.5 from other places. The survey for public perception showed that 60% of the respondents perceived improvement in air quality. Household emissions were perceived to be a significant source of pollution after the lockdown. An odds ratio (OR) of 17 (95%, CI: 6.42, 47.04) indicated a very high dependence of perception on actual air quality. OR between air quality and health improvement was 5.2 (95%, CI: 2.69, 10.01), indicating significant health improvement due to air quality improvement. Google Trends analysis showed that media did not influence shaping the perception. There was a significant improve-ment in the actual and perceived air quality in India after the COVID-19-induced lockdown. PM10 levels had the most decisive influence in shaping public perception.(c) 2022 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

224;An assessment of perceptions of air quality surrounding the implementation of a traffic-reduction measure in a local urban environment;"Schmitz, S; Weiand, L; Becker, S; Niehoff, N; Schwartzbach, F; von Schneidemesser, E";Poor air quality remains a major environmental and health risk in Europe, despite improvements over the last few decades. Consistent exceedances of the nitrogen dioxide air quality limit values at a roadside monitoring station in Potsdam, owing to heavy local and commuter individual motorized traffic, prompted the city administration to implement a trial traffic measure aimed at reducing motorized traffic to improve air quality. This study analysed data (n = 3553) from a questionnaire carried out prior to the implementation of the trial traffic measure. This research provides a case-study to contribute to the understanding of general determinants of air quality perceptions, and policy-relevant information regarding how citizens perceive air quality in the context of a 'hard' policy measure. A subset of variables was used to build an ordinal logistic regression model to assess the explanatory power for air quality perceptions. Gender, perceived health status, level of concern for air quality, level of concern for climate change, and the desire for greater access to information regarding air quality were factors found to be significant in their explanatory power of perceptions of air quality. The results are discussed in the broader policy context of attempts to improve air quality in urban environments.;"Air quality; Perception; Sustainable urban transport; Spatial analysis; Local; Transdisciplinary";"Climate change; Health risks; Nitrogen oxides; Regression analysis; Sensory perception; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Environmental and health risks; Local; Ordinal logistic regression; Quality perceptions; Roadside monitoring station; Spatial analysis; Transdisciplinary; Urban transport; Air quality";"POLLUTION; HEALTH; BEHAVIOR";1;0;1;0;0;1;Keith

255;Exposure to online news about air pollution and public trust in regulators in China: a moderated mediation analysis of perceived risk and perceived news credibility;Huang, Q;Public trust in regulators is critical to the effective management of environmental risks. This study proposes a model to explicate how people's online news exposure, perceived risk, and perceived news credibility influence their trust in regulators concerning the issue of air pollution in China. An online survey showed that perceived risk fully mediated the relationship between online news exposure and trust in regulators. Through moderating the association between online news exposure and perceived risk, perceived news credibility also moderated the indirect effect: the negative indirect effect of online news exposure on trust in regulators via perceived risk was stronger when the level of perceived news credibility was high than when it was low. The results suggest that online news that attempts to make the public more conscious of air pollution hazards reduces public trust in regulators, especially when people perceive the news as highly credible. News media are supposed to inform the public of the issue and thus help air pollution management. However, the findings alert us that the amplification of public risk perception resulting from frequent online news exposure and the subsequent decline in public trust in regulators might impede the effective regulation of air pollution.;"Online news exposure; perceived risk; perceived news credibility; trust in regulators; air pollution";;;0;0;0;0;0;0;Keith
269;Determinants of Beijing Residents Intentions to Take Protective Behaviors against Smog: An Application of the Health Belief Model;"Chen Y.; Liu X.";Severe smog, a form of air pollution, has become a threat to public health in Beijing, China. To examine Beijing residents protective behavioral intentions against smog, we proposed a conceptual model, which applies the health belief model (HBM) and specifies the roles of three distal predictors: exposure to news, discussion, and worry. The proposed model was tested in the context of protective behavioral intentions (i.e., intention to wear facemask & intention to use air purifier). Data were collected from Beijing residents during the period from 2/27 to 3/7 in 2017. Structural-equation-modeling (SEM) analyses of valid cases (N = 523) found support for the health belief model regarding the positive effects of perceived threat, perceived benefit, and perceived self-efficacy on intention to wear facemask or intention to use air purifier. Perceived barrier has a negative effect on intention to use air purifier, but is not related to intention to wear facemask. Neither exposure nor discussion is related to perceived threat. The effect of worry on intention to wear facemaskor intention to use air purifier is mediated by perceived threat. This proposed mediating mechanism is superior to the reverse mechanism (that worry mediates perceived threat). Implications of findings were discussed. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.;;"Beijing; Health Behavior; Health Belief Model; Humans; Intention; Smog; Surveys and Questionnaires; behavior; China; health behavior; Health Belief Model; human; questionnaire; smog";;1;1;0;1;0;1;Keith
289;Ambient air pollution perception and coping behaviour among hikers;Wang, WC;Air pollution is becoming a global issue affecting many places around the world. In recent years, issues regarding air quality, leisure-time physical activity and tourists' behavioural intentions have been of considerable concern. This study aims to explore the impact of air pollution on hikers' hiking behaviour based on the stress coping theory and also examine the differences of hikers from two locations within different air quality. On-site questionnaire survey was conducted to understand hikers' perceptions of air pollution, stress induced by air pollution, and coping behaviours. Overall, 400 questionnaires were completed, of which 336 were valid. Results of independent t-test indicated that although the air quality of Xiangshan was better than Shoushan for long periods of time, Xiangshan hikers were more likely to use absolute substitution than Shoushan hikers when facing air pollution. Moreover, based on the results of the regression analysis, perception of air pollution and stress associated with air pollution were determined to be correlated with coping behaviours. Behavioural coping strategies rather than cognitive coping strategies were employed when hikers encountered air pollution. Finally, managerial implications and suggestions for future research were proposed based on the results.;"Outdoor recreation; air quality; coping strategy; hiking; tourists";"China; Jiangxi; Xiangshan; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; perception; questionnaire survey; tourist behavior";"TIME PHYSICAL INACTIVITY; OUTDOOR RECREATION; ASSOCIATION; SUBSTITUTABILITY; SUBSTITUTION; TOURISM; QUALITY; ANGLERS; ALERTS; HEALTH";1;1;0;0;0;1;Keith

319;Particulate matter source attribution and restaurant mitigation behavioral intentions: an application of attribution theory;"Jang, E; Yoo, JJE; Cho, M";Purpose As commercial cooking is known as a source that generates great concentrations of particulate matter (PM) emissions first accumulating in kitchens before spreading to dining areas, this study aims to explore how to improve restaurants' efforts to reduce PM emissions by the application of attribution theory. Design/methodology/approach Data were obtained from restaurant managers operating their business in South Korea, considered to be qualified to provide accurate information regarding the survey questions. A scenario-based experimental approach was used to test the hypothesized relationships. Cognitive and emotional risk judgements were assessed for its potential interaction effects on the relationships between restaurant perceptions of PM source attributions, preventions attitudes and mitigation behavioral intentions. Findings Results revealed that perceptions of PM main sources were attributed to internal rather than external factors, which improved mitigation behavioral intentions. Such an effect was partially mediated through PM pollution prevention attitudes. Additionally, when applying external source attributions, PM mitigation behavioral intentions were improved by cognitive risk judgements, and PM prevention attitudes were enhanced by affective risk judgements. Research limitations/implications Results assist restaurants to better understand their operations that may be emitting significant levels of PM, thereby encouraging them to set more ambitious and effective PM mitigation operational guidelines for their employees and diners. Originality/value This study provides a fundamental baseline of management perceptions regarding PM emissions related to restaurant mitigation behavioral intentions. Results are useful in designing appropriate communication strategies addressing restaurant PM pollution issues to improve internal restaurant practices regarding clean air quality.;"Attribution theory; Particulate matter; Cognitive and affective risk judgements; Commercial cooking; Mitigation behavioral intentions; Risk attribution";;"RISK PERCEPTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COOKING; POLLUTION; BELIEFS";1;1;0;0;0;1;Keith
347;Public Perceptions of How Long Air Pollution and Carbon Dioxide Remain in the Atmosphere;"Dryden, R; Morgan, MG; Bostrom, A; de Bruin, WB";The atmospheric residence time of carbon dioxide is hundreds of years, many orders of magnitude longer than that of common air pollution, which is typically hours to a few days. However, randomly selected respondents in a mail survey in Allegheny County, PA (N = 119) and in a national survey conducted with MTurk (N = 1,013) judged the two to be identical (in decades), considerably overestimating the residence time of air pollution and drastically underestimating that of carbon dioxide. Moreover, while many respondents believed that action is needed today to avoid climate change (regardless of cause), roughly a quarter held the view that if climate change is real and serious, we will be able to stop it in the future when it happens, just as we did with common air pollution. In addition to assessing respondents' understanding of how long carbon dioxide and common air pollution stay in the atmosphere, we also explored the extent to which people correctly identified causes of climate change and how their beliefs affect support for action. With climate change at the forefront of politics and mainstream media, informing discussions of policy is increasingly important. Confusion about the causes and consequences of climate change, and especially about carbon dioxide's long atmospheric residence time, could have profound implications for sustained support of policies to achieve reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases.;"Air pollution; atmospheric residence time; carbon dioxide";"Allegheny County; Pennsylvania; United States; Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Pollution; Surveys; Atmospheric residence time; Carbon dioxide emissions; Mail surveys; Mainstream media; National surveys; Orders of magnitude; Public perception; Residence time; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; greenhouse gas; perception; questionnaire survey; residence time; Climate change";"GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; PEOPLE KNOW; CHANGE RISK; KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE";1;0;0;0;0;1;Keith
369;RETRACTED: Nationwide response to air pollution: Environmental behavior model based on self-identity and social identity process (Retracted Article);"Huang, LP; Ou, J; Gao, J";Environmental problems such as air pollution are global, and are created by human collective behavior. Accordingly, their remedies call for residents to transform their Pro-environmental behavior (PEB) from individual level to collective level. Based on the perspective of self-identity process and social identity process, this research proposes a comprehensive model by integrating elements from theory of planned behavior (TPB), self-identity theory and social identity theory. To assess the model, we have designed questionnaire and collected the survey data using Questionnaire Star (a professional data platform in China). The data were analyzed using both structural equation model (AMOS) and regression analysis (SPSS). It is found that there exist interactions between individual and collective factors, and their positive influence on PEB of the individuals with varying strengths. The broader view of the model can enhance our understanding regarding the intricate internal structure of ecological behavior, and it can also offer valuable reference when formulating environmental policies and education strategies.;"Self-identity process; social identity process; individual Pro-environmental behavior; collective Pro-environmental behavior";;"COLLECTIVE EFFICACY; GREEN; ANTECEDENTS; INTENTIONS; AGENCY";1;1;0;0;0;1;Keith
409;Traffic-Related Air Pollution, Noise at School, and Behavioral Problems in Barcelona Schoolchildren: A Cross-Sectional Study;"Forns, J; Dadvand, P; Foraster, M; Alvarez-Pedrerol, M; Rivas, I; López-Vicente, M; Suades-Gonzalez, E; Garcia-Esteban, R; Esnaola, M; Cirach, M; Grellier, J; Basagaña, X; Querol, X; Guxens, M; Nieuwenhuijsen, MJ; Sunyer, J";BACKGROUND: The available evidence of the effects of air pollution and noise on behavioral development is limited, and it overlooks exposure at schools, where children spend a considerable amount of time. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the associations of exposure to traffic-related air pollutants (TRAPs) and noise at school on behavioral development of schoolchildren. METHODS: We evaluated children 7-11 years of age in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) during 2012-2013 within the BREATHE project. Indoor and outdoor concentrations of elemental carbon (EC), black carbon (BC), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were measured at schools in two separate 1-week campaigns. In one campaign we also measured noise levels inside classrooms. Parents filled out the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) to assess child behavioral development, while teachers completed the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder criteria of the DSM-IV (ADHD-DSM- IV) list to assess specific ADHD symptomatology. Negative binomial mixed-effects models were used to estimate associations between the exposures and behavioral development scores. RESULTS: Interquartile range (IQR) increases in indoor and outdoor EC, BC, and NO2 concentrations were positively associated with SDQ total difficulties scores (suggesting more frequent behavioral problems) in adjusted multivariate models, whereas noise was significantly associated with ADHD-DSM-IV scores. CONCLUSION: In our study population of 7-to 11-year-old children residing in Barcelona, exposure to TRAPs at school was associated with increased behavioral problems in schoolchildren. Noise exposure at school was associated with more ADHD symptoms.;;"Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Nitrogen Dioxide; Noise; Particulate Matter; Problem Behavior; Schools; Spain; Vehicle Emissions; black carbon; carbon; nitrogen dioxide; air pollutant; exhaust gas; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; academic achievement; age; air pollution; Article; assessment of humans; attention deficit disorder; child; child behavior; cross-sectional study; disease association; DSM-IV; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; female; gender; human; male; noise; noise pollution; priority journal; problem behavior; school; school child; Spain; Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; symptomatology; vulnerable population; adverse effects; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; chemically induced; exhaust gas; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; toxicity";"DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; USE REGRESSION-MODELS; DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONNAIRE; TRANSPORTATION NOISE; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; ESCAPE PROJECT; AIRCRAFT NOISE; MENTAL-HEALTH; CHILDREN; OUTDOOR";0;0;0;0;0;0;Keith
443;Level of Awareness about Air Pollution among Decision-makers in Jordan: Unveiling Important COPD Etiology;"Alrabadi, N; Alsayed, AR; Saadeh, R; AL Loze, KJ; Aljanabi, M; Al-Khamaiseh, AM";Purpose: The complete awareness of policymakers about air pollution can play a significant role in dealing with this environmental threat. This study aimed to examine the awareness and perception among the policymakers regarding air pollution in Jordan. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Jordan. The participants included in this study were governmental and non-governmental officials from different sectors. An interview and questionnaire were used to examine the extent of knowledge of these decision-makers regarding air pollution types, sources, and threats. Results: Most participants acknowledged that air pollution in Jordan was a huge problem. Most participants (90%) were familiar with the term air pollution, and regularly read about different contaminants that cause air pollution. However, most of the participants had a low level of knowledge about air contaminant types in Jordan. The least known pollutants were PM2.5 (Particulate Matter 2.5 microns in width) and PM10 (Particulate Matter 10 microns in width). Only 7.5% of the participants knew about PM2.5, while 12.5% knew about PM10. Conclusion: Policymakers have the full authority to initiate and implement policies that intend to limit air pollution. Their complete awareness of air pollution can result in conducting certain protocols to approve new policies and legislations that can improve the air quality in Jordan. Unfortunately, no previous studies were conducted to analyze policymakers' knowledge regarding air pollution in Jordan, and this study's results hoped to reflect the importance of air pollutants and their greater significance on public health.;"air pollution; COPD; knowledge; policymakers; middle east";"carbon monoxide; air pollution; air quality; Article; awareness; chronic obstructive lung disease; environmental exposure; environmental protection; health care policy; human; interview; knowledge; particulate matter; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; public health; questionnaire; respiratory tract disease";;1;0;0;0;0;1;Keith
500;Air Pollution and Climate Change Risk Perception among Residents in Three Cities of the Mexico Megalopolis;"Landeros-Mugica, K; Urbina-Soria, J; Angeles-Hernandez, DI; Gutierrez-Arzaluz, M; Mugica-alvarez, V; Cheng, YH";Recent reports of the criteria pollutants in the Megalopolis, located in the central part of Mexico, consistently show air quality standard exceedances in most of the cities that make it up, since it is a large concentration where approximately 17% of the national population resides and because it has significant commercial and industrial development. To investigate the similarities and disparities in risk perception concerning air pollution and climate change among residents living in Central Mexico, a cross-sectional survey study was carried out within three metropolitan areas encompassed by the Megalopolis. A total of 1750 questionnaire surveys were conducted across 21 municipalities within the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA), 16 municipalities within the Toluca Valley Metropolitan Area (TVMA), and 8 municipalities within the Cuernavaca Metropolitan Area. The three metropolitan areas showed significant differences in terms of air quality perception, risk perception, attitudes, and causal attribution perception, but health-related perception did not have significant differences among the areas. The MCMA exhibited higher knowledge about air pollution, although it associated the causes with urban activities such as car usage, while the Toluca and Cuernavaca areas linked this issue to the burning of garbage, coal, wood, and agricultural activities. Although residents expressed concern about air pollution, climate change, and their effects, they do not know how to act to contribute to the solution.;"risk perception; air pollution; climate change; attitudes; causal attributions";"Mexico [Mexico (NTN)]; Mexico [North America]; Toluca Valley; Air quality; Health risks; Risk perception; Technology transfer; Attitude; Causal attributions; Central Mexico; Climate change risks; Commercial development; Cross-sectional surveys; Industrial development; Me-xico; Metropolitan area; Mexico City metropolitan areas; air quality; atmospheric pollution; climate change; industrial development; metropolitan area; risk perception; Climate change";"SOCIAL-SCIENCE; MITIGATION; BEHAVIORS; KNOWLEDGE";1;0;0;0;0;1;Keith
508;Linking Occupant Behavior and Window Design through Post-Occupancy Evaluation: Enhancing Natural Ventilation and Indoor Air Quality;"Pourtangestani, M; Izadyar, N; Jamei, E; Vrcelj, Z";This study investigates how window design features, such as size, placement, and orientation, might impact occupants' behavior related to natural ventilation in residential houses and how residents manage natural ventilation to affect indoor air quality (IAQ), comfort, and energy efficiency. By analyzing responses from a questionnaire distributed among 200 occupants, this article reveals that stuffy air, perceived outdoor pollutants, odors, and relative humidity, along with factors like inadequate ventilation, temperature fluctuations, and energy consumption concerns, emerge as primary issues affecting occupants' comfort and well-being. This study proposes design recommendations for enhancing IAQ, including optimal window placement for cross-ventilation, window-to-wall ratio (WWR) considerations, and the integration of smart window technologies. This research recognizes that window design is not just a technical matter but involves understanding social and behavioral factors as well. By analyzing occupant responses, it aims to provide insights into the socio-technical parameters that should be considered in window design. The findings offer valuable strategies for architects, designers, and homeowners to optimize natural ventilation and underscore the importance of an occupant-centered approach in sustainable building design.;"indoor air quality (IAQ); natural ventilation; window design; occupants' behavior; occupants' perceptions";"Air quality; Architectural design; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Indoor air pollution; Intelligent buildings; Behavior design; Design features; Indoor air quality; Natural ventilation; Occupant perception; Occupants behaviours; Post occupancy evaluation; Ventilation airs; Window designs; Ventilation";"THERMAL COMFORT; ENERGY PERFORMANCE; BUILDING SHAPE; ZONES";0;0;0;0;0;0;Keith
527;Risk Reduction Behaviors Regarding PM2.5 Exposure among Outdoor Exercisers in the Nanjing Metropolitan Area, China;"Xiong, LL; Li, J; Xia, T; Hu, XY; Wang, Y; Sun, MN; Tang, M";Aims: This study aimed to describe risk reduction behaviors regarding ambient particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 m or less (PM2.5) among outdoor exercisers and to explore potential factors influencing those behaviors in the urban area of Nanjing, China. Method: A cross-sectional convenience sample survey was conducted among 302 outdoor exercisers in May 2015. Descriptive analysis was used to describe demographics, outdoor physical activity patterns, knowledge of PM2.5 and risk reduction behaviors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was then used to explore factors that influence the adoption of risk reduction behaviors. Results: The most common behavior to reduce PM2.5 exposure was minimizing the times for opening windows on hazy days (75.5%), and the least common one was using air purifiers (19.3%). Two thirds of respondents indicated that they wore face masks when going outside in the haze (59.5%), but only 13.6% of them would wear professional antismog face masks. Participants adopting risk reduction behaviors regarding PM2.5 exposure tended to be females, 50-60 year-olds, those with higher levels of knowledge about PM2.5 and those who had children. Conclusions: These findings indicate the importance of improving knowledge about PM2.5 among outdoor exercisers. Educational interventions should also be necessary to guide the public to take appropriate precautionary measures when undertaking outdoor exercise in high PM2.5 pollution areas.;"risk reduction behavior; PM2.5; outdoor exercisers; influencing factors; China";"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants; China; Cities; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Exposure; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Risk Reduction Behavior; Urban Health; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; health risk; metropolitan area; multivariate analysis; particulate matter; physical activity; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; regression analysis; risk assessment; urban atmosphere; adult; aged; air pollution; Article; China; convenience sample; cross-sectional study; exercise; female; haze; human; male; middle aged; particulate matter; risk reduction; smog; urban population; air pollutant; analysis; city; environmental exposure; exercise; particle size; particulate matter; physiology; prevention and control; urban health; very elderly";"POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; AIR-POLLUTION; PARTICULATE MATTER; INDIVIDUAL EXPOSURE; HEALTH-RISKS; LUNG-CANCER; MORTALITY; INDOOR; HAZE; ASSOCIATION";1;1;0;0;0;1;Keith
528;The Theory of Planned Behavior to Predict Protective Behavioral Intentions against PM2.5 in Parents of Young Children from Urban and Rural Beijing, China;"Liu, SM; Chiang, YT; Tseng, CC; Ng, E; Yeh, GL; Fang, WT";Smog and air pollution have fast become significant environmental problems and are attributed to rapid global industrialization and urbanization. Emissions of fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) increase smog and air pollution, with strong impacts on human health. Children are particularly vulnerable. While increasing studies are being conducted on the behaviors leading to PM2.5 toxicity from the perspective of environmental toxicants, there is a lack of research on factors influencing anti-PM2.5 behavioral intentions. Thus, this study aims to narrow this gap by adapting the theory of planned behavior framework to investigate the effects of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control on protective behavioral intentions against PM2.5. In total, 1277 online questionnaires were collected from parents of young children living in urban and rural areas of Beijing, and the data was analyzed using correlation, regression, and path analyses. Results revealed that there were significant differences between parents from urban and rural areas in terms of attitude (t = 4.727 > 1.96, p < 0.001), subjective norms (t = 5.529 > 1.96, p < 0.001), perceived behavioral control (t = 6.155 > 1.96, p < 0.001), and anti-PM2.5 behavioral intentions (t = 6.838 > 1.96, p < 0.001). Path analysis revealed that parents from urban and rural areas had different behavioral intention paths. For urban parents, the findings indicated that subjective norms (beta = 0.73, t = 21.84 > 3.29) and perceived behavioral control (gamma = 0.22, t = 6.12 > 3.29) had direct impacts on anti-PM2.5 behavioral intentions. In contrast, the attitudes (gamma = 0.39, t = 3.74 > 3.29) and subjective norms (beta = 0.60, t = 8.55 > 3.29) of rural parents were found to directly influence anti-PM2.5 behavioral intentions.;"theory of planned behavior; anti-PM2.5 behavioral intention; young children's parents; rural and urban areas";"Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Attitude; Beijing; Child; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Intention; Male; Parents; Particulate Matter; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban Population; Urbanization; Beijing [China]; China; atmospheric pollution; behavioral response; child health; geodynamics; health risk; particulate matter; prediction; questionnaire survey; rural area; theoretical study; urban area; article; child; China; clinical article; female; human; male; path analysis; questionnaire; remission; rural area; Theory of Planned Behavior; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; attitude; behavior; child parent relation; China; health behavior; particulate matter; psychology; rural population; urban population; urbanization";"PARTICULATE MATTER PM2.5; SUBJECTIVE NORM; AIR-POLLUTION; FINE PARTICULATE; EXTENDED THEORY; RESPIRATORY-DISEASES; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; REASONED ACTION; RIVER DELTA; HEALTH";1;1;0;0;0;1;Keith
531;Public perception of haze weather based on Weibo comments;"Zhang Q.; Chen J.; Liu X.";In China, haze weather has become a major public concern and is frantically discussed by the public. Many people express their views, opinions, or complaints on social media. Effectively extracting this useful information may help to improve our understanding of how the public perceive and respond to haze, and could potentially contribute to environmental policy-making. In this paper, we study how the public perceive haze during haze weather and how this perception changes with seasons based on comment data from a major social media platform in China, Weibo, and using several social network methods, including perceptual keyword cloud mapping, complex network topology characteristics, and social perception analysis. The results showed that the publics perception was focused on the causes of haze in spring, enjoyment of life and travel in summer, measures to prevent haze in autumn, and the adverse effects of haze on human health in winter. © 2019 by the authors.

547;Development and Validation of the Haze Risk Perception Scale and Influencing Factor Scale-A Study Based on College Students in Beijing;"Zhang, YB; Chen, JW; Wei, XF; Wu, X";"Although Beijing's air quality has improved, there is still a long way to go for haze governance. In order to understand haze risk perception and related influencing factors among college students in Beijing, we developed and verified two scales, with college students as the survey object, and analyzed the theoretical framework and realistic level of haze risk perception and influencing factors through empirical research. We showed that the reliability and validity of the two scales are excellent, and they can be used as a powerful tool to measure college students' perception of haze. The haze risk perception scale (HRPS) is divided into four dimensions. The degrees of perception ranked from high to low are: direct consequences perception, indirect consequences perception, risk responsibility perception and risk source perception. The haze risk perception influencing factor scale (HRPIFS) is divided into three dimensions. The degrees of influence ranked from high to low are: personal emotion, media communication and government policy; the three influencing factors all have a significant positive correlation to overall haze risk perception, but personal emotions and media communication are only significantly related to the three dimensions of direct consequence perception, indirect consequence perception and risk source perception. Government policy is only significantly related to the three dimensions of direct consequence perception, indirect consequence perception and risk liability perception. This paper proves the important role of media in haze risk perception and puts forward some policy suggestions to guide the public to form a rational risk perception. These findings can help improve theoretical and practical research related to haze risk.";"haze; risk perception; influencing factors; scale; college students in Beijing";"Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Government; Humans; Perception; Reproducibility of Results; Students; Beijing [China]; China; air quality; haze; risk perception; student; article; China; college student; conceptual framework; emotion; empirical research; government; haze; human; human experiment; perception; reliability; responsibility; risk perception; theoretical study; validation process; validity; air pollutant; air pollution; China; reproducibility; student";"RESPONSIBILITY; POLLUTION; CHINA; ATTRIBUTION; RESPONSES; EXPOSURE; PM2.5; TRUST; CITY";1;0;0;0;0;1;Keith
587;An Assessment of the Multidimensional Drivers and Determinants of Public Risk Perception of and Behaviors Related to Exposure to Air Pollution in Serbia;"Stanojevic, G; Malinovic-Milicevic, S; Curcic, NB; Radovanovic, M; Radivojevic, A; Popovic, T; Curcic, S";This study investigates factors contributing to public perception of and behaviors related to air pollution in Serbia. A range of multidimensional indicators, including demographic and socioeconomic features, health status data, and living environment factors, were utilized to evaluate observed awareness and exposure activities. Air pollution is a serious health concern in many areas of Serbia, particularly during the cold season when emissions from the heating sector contribute to high levels of particulate matter. In the period from March to May 2023, a nationwide survey was conducted to gather empirical data and insights that can assist policymakers in the creation of public-health strategies. A set of research questions included the perception of air-pollution impact and citizens' responses to eight pre-defined exposure-reduction activities. Statistical procedures (a chi-square test of independence, a Mann-Whitney U test, and a Kruskal-Wallis H test) were applied to isolate driving factors in the public response to increased air-pollution levels. The findings suggest a gap between risk understanding and risk-reducing behaviors. To address this issue and to ensure that regulations are implemented effectively, it is crucial to prioritize education, develop communication strategies, increase local interventions, and target vulnerable population groups.;"air pollution; multidimensional drivers; public perception; exposure behaviors; Serbia";"Serbia; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; health status; health survey; heating; public attitude; risk perception";"QUALITY; HEALTH; UNDERSTANDINGS";1;1;0;0;0;1;Keith
594;Air Quality, Pollution Perception, and Residents' Health: Evidence from China;"Zhu, J; Lu, CT";Environmental and resident health issues associated with air pollution are an area of growing concern for both policy officials and the general public. In recent years, China has been accelerating the construction of a Beautiful China and a Healthy China, with the aim of protecting and improving the environment and ensuring public health. In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of air quality and air pollution perception on residents' health. This study used the 2017 Chinese General Social Survey data to measure self-rated health, mental health, and air pollution perception. Using matched socioeconomic indicators and air pollution data, we analyzed the relationship between subjective perception of air pollution, objective air pollution data, and residents' health. The results showed the following: (1) Air pollution perception has a significant negative impact on self-rated health and mental health. Thus, it needs more consideration to reduce environmental health risks. (2) Objective air pollution has a significant negative impact on mental health. At the same time, its effect on self-rated health was insignificant. These results provide empirical evidence supporting the Chinese government's decision to invest more in combating air pollution and ensuring the health of Chinese residents.;"health; air pollution; pollution perception";"adult; air pollution; air quality; article; China; Chinese; controlled study; environmental health; female; government; human; human experiment; male; mental health; perception; resident";"SELF-RATED HEALTH; LIFE SATISFACTION; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY; OF-LIFE; INEQUALITIES; MORTALITY; IMPACT; URBAN; HAPPINESS";1;0;0;1;0;1;Keith
601;Population's perception on air pollution in Beirut;"Khazen, MA; Adjizian-Gerard, J; Flanquart, H";Studies have shown that the air above Beirut, the Lebanese capital, is polluted. The concentration of NO(2 )and particulate matters are always above the acceptable limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2016, a survey has been done to study the perception of Beirut's population on the air pollution. The survey has shown that the population does perceive the bad quality of the air above the city and its primary source: road traffic. On the other hand, the population perceives the risks related to the security situation as more important than the environmental or traffic related risks. The study has also resulted that individuals perceive that air pollution affects others more then it affects them and a disparity between the different religion denominations regarding the perception of the different risks in general and environmental risks in particular, a point which we cannot explain in this stage.;"Beirut; air pollution; perception; cognitive dissonance; risk";"Beirut [Beyrouth]; Beyrouth; Lebanon; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); nitrogen dioxide; perception; risk assessment; urban area; urban pollution";"EXPOSURE; RISK; LEBANON; SITE";1;0;0;0;0;1;Keith

Methods: This study used a convenience sample and subjects were collected from a community in Wuchang District and Children's Hospital of Wuhan, respectively. A designed questionnaire was used for this study. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to analyze the relationship between parents' individual and familial characteristics and related behavioral intensions to air quality improvement. Statistical analysis was done with SAS 9.1. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 865 subjects (response rate = 86.5%). The number of people with migrant intent was 150(36.4%) from hospital group, and 139(30.7%) from community group. In the hospital group, subjects with higher knowledge of air quality (OR = 6.268, p < 0.05) and higher average annual household income (AAHI), which was equal or more than 50,000 Yuan (OR = 2.045, p < 0.01), were found to be more intent to migrate. AAHI (OR = 1.939, p < 0.05) was also the affecting factor in the community group correspondingly. Those willing to pay for air quality improvement included 297 people (72.1%) from the hospital group and 333 people (73.5%) from the community group, and affecting factors was the public responsibility for air quality improvement (hospital group: OR = 3.380, p < 0.01; community group: OR = 4.436, p < 0.01). Conclusions: This study indicated high tendency of propensity to migrate for avoiding poor air condition and willingness to pay to improve air quality in Wuhan.

Namely, the Kostrena living area (3250 inhabitants) is situated near big industrial pollutant producers: INA oil refinery Urinj, thermo power plant Rijeka, shipyard »Viktor Lenac«, while in Crikvenica living area such pollutant producers do not exist. In this research 146 subjects from Kostrena participated (74 men and 72 women with age average 40.8, SD 9.2 years), and 157 subjects from Crikvenica area (79 men and 78 women with age average 39.4, SD 10.1 years). The perception of health was measured by the means of SF-36 questionnaire variables. Lung function (FEV1, FVC, FEV 25/75, PEF), cardiovascular function (systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure, heart rate were also measured, including body proporton measures by the means of waste and hip circumference and silhouette test, in order to establish the eventual objective physical health parametar difference among examined population groups. Subjects from Kostrena perceived their general health, mental health, and vitality worse than subjects from Crikvenica. Group from Kostrena felt themself more limited in their roles due to emotional problems, perceiving more pain than group from Crikvenica. On the opposite site, social functioning of subjects from Kostrena was better in comparison to Crikvenica group. No signifficant differences between groups were found in physical functioning and in role limitation due to physical problems. In addition, there were no signifficant differences between groups in objective physical health parameters, such as pulmonary function, arterial blood pressure, pulse, and waist to hip ratio. Subjects using sensoric systems and the mental cognition about harmfull environmental factors, percieve their health worse if there are present industrial resources in their environment, even when concentration of the pollutants are within legal ranges.;"Air quality; Perception of health; Pulmonary and cardiovascular function; SF-36 questionnaire";"Adult; Air Pollution; Attitude to Health; Croatia; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Psychology, Industrial; Questionnaires; adult; air pollution; article; attitude to health; Croatia; female; health status; human; male; mental health; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; statistics";;0;0;0;0;0;0;Keith

The study took place during three cold days in February 2017. Fourteen subjects were blindly exposed to different levels of RH in the order of low (14 +/- 1%), high (38 +/- 3%), and medium (24 +/- 4%). The subjects received emails twice a day (at 12:00 and at 14:30) with a link to a webpage where they were asked to: (1) assess perceived air quality (PAQ), (2) respond to a questionnaire about indoor environment quality and symptoms. The subjects performed normal office activity in between the two sessions. We found no significant impact of the level of RH on PAQ. Nevertheless, there were significantly more complaints about dry air at low RH than at medium and high RH. Furthermore, the air was perceived to be significantly more stuffy and heavier at high RH than at medium RH. There were no significant differences in thermal comfort at different RH, yet more people complained that it was cold on the day with low RH and warm on the day with high RH. Generally, there were few complaints related to symptoms at different RH. There were however significantly more complaints of itching and burning in the eyes at low RH than at medium and high RH.;"Relative humidity; Perceived air quality; Thermal comfort; Dry air; Symptoms";;"INDOOR; TEMPERATURE; IMPACT";1;0;0;0;0;1;Camille
15;Health protection and climate change require ambitious limit values for air pollutants in Europe. Opinion on the revision of the Directive on Air Quality and Clean Air for Europe of the Environmental Public Health commission of the Robert Koch Institute and the Federal Environment Agency;"Peters, A; Herr, C; Bolte, G; Heutelbeck, A; Hornberg, C; Kraus, T; Lakes, T; Matzarakis, A; Novak, D; Reifegerste, D; Traidl-Hoffmann, C; Zeeb, H; Schneider, A; Hoffmann, B";Based on scientific findings, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended stricter guideline values for air quality in 2021. Significant reductions in the annual mean values of particulatematter (particle size 2.5 mu m or smaller, PM2.5) and long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3) were put forward. The risk of mortality already increases above the WHO guideline values, as shown in studies investigating low concentrations of air pollutants. In Germany, the 2021 WHO guideline values for PM2.5 and NO2 were clearly exceeded in 2022. In this position paper we give the following recommendations for the European Air Quality Directive: (1) set binding limit values according to WHO 2021, (2) apply the limit values to the whole of Europe, (3) continue and expand the established country-based monitoring networks, (4) expand air quality measurements for ultrafine particles and soot particles, and (5) link air pollution control and climate protectionmeasures. Stricter limits for air pollutants require societal and political changes in areas such as mobility, energy use and generation, and urban and spatial planning. Implementation according to WHO 2021 would lead to a net economic benefit of 38 billion euros per year. Ambitious limit values for air pollutants also have an impact on climate changemitigation and its health impacts.

38;Investigation of NO2 Behaviour in the Temperate Continental Climate Road Environment;"Sereviciene, V; Baltrenas, P; Baltrenaite, E; Marciulaitiene, E; Paliulis, D";During an extended period from 2010-2012 ambient air quality researches, concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the air was measured applying the passive method. In order to evaluate the spatial distribution of pollutants and the major sources, 12 sampling sites across the region were chosen. Additionally, the seasonal changes of this pollutant under different meteorological conditions (air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction) were investigated. The long-term study showed 3.8 times higher NO2 concentrations in the Mazeikiai urban area (24.2 mu g m(-3)) as compared to other locations in the region (6.3 mu g m(-3)). This confirms the assumption that the main source of NO2 in this area is motor vehicle exhaust fumes. The analysis of the results obtained in different seasons showed a significant difference (p<0.05) in NO2 concentrations under different meteorological conditions. The increase in NO2 concentrations was recorded in the winter and late autumn seasons, due to reduced solar radiation and lower temperatures. Cluster analysis results showed that sampling sites can be grouped into different classes based on NO2 main source, motor vehicles and traffic intensity.;"Air pollution; Crude oil refinery; Nitrogen dioxide; Passive samplers; Seasonal variation";;"AMBIENT NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; AIR-QUALITY; PASSIVE SAMPLERS; STACK EMISSIONS; POLLUTION; URBAN; POLLUTANTS; REFINERY; VICINITY; COMPLEX";0;0;0;0;0;0;Camille
49;Is there a stronger willingness to pay for air quality improvement with high education: new evidence from a survey in China;"Hu, L; Liao, WM";As a developing country with the largest population and serious environmental pollution in the world, China has made great efforts in air pollution. Air quality improvement depends not only on government administrative regulations but also on public support, especially how much the public is willing to pay for air quality improvement. Higher education will encourage the public to take action to improve air quality. However, the confirmation of the causality relationship between WTP and education has been missing. This study uses the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) to find the relationship between the two, and the conclusions are drawn: OLS regression model and instrumental variable both determine the positive influence of education level on air quality improvement WTP, and Heckman model further verifies the robustness of the conclusion. The positive influence of education level is greater in the groups of men, higher income, higher awareness of acid rain, and more air purifiers, and it has a greater impact on married people in rural areas than in urban areas. The function mechanism of education can improve residents' WTP by increasing regional GDP, promoting urbanization level, expanding afforestation areas, decreasing private car ownership and the number of newly registered civil cars, and reducing sulfur dioxide emissions, nitrogen oxides, and smoke (powder) dust. The total social and economic value of air quality improvement in China is 34.572 billion CNY to 672.42 trillion CNY.;"Air quality improvement; Willingness to pay; Education level; Instrumental variable; Compulsory education law";"Air Pollution; China; Educational Status; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Male; Quality Improvement; China; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission control; higher education; rural area; urbanization; willingness to pay; air pollution; China; educational status; human; male; pollution; total quality management";"POLLUTION; VALUATION; EMISSIONS; HEALTH";0;0;1;0;0;1;Camille
73;MODIFICATIONS OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR IN RESPONSE TO AIR-POLLUTION NOTIFICATIONS IN COPENHAGEN;"SKOV, T; CORDTZ, T; JENSEN, LK; SAUGMAN, P; SCHMIDT, K; THEILADE, P";Ambient air quality is a major issue today in large cities all over the world. On the theoretical background of the health belief model and the health locus of control model, we studied the knowledge and beliefs about air pollution and the modifications of health behaviour brought about by information to the public about projected levels of air pollution, with special emphasis on reduction of outdoor activity and avoidance of car driving. Data were collected with a questionnaire among a sample of residents in the Copenhagen area. The respondents were almost universally knowledgeable about the prime emission source and concerned about the possible health effects of the air pollution in the area. Avoidance of outdoor activity was associated with personal experiences of symptoms ascribed to the air pollution, employment status, and with female sex, but not with knowledge or beliefs about the degree or health implications of the air pollution. The willingness to avoid car driving was positively associated with the belief that one can oneself influence one's health and with female sex. Lung diseased respondents were generally more prone to protect themselves than the healthy, both by avoiding outdoor activity and by being less willing to avoid car driving. The present study was conducted in an only moderately polluted city, and it is not clear whether the findings and conclusions can be generalized to more polluted cities. The study partly supported the underlying theories of the determinants of health behaviour, but also indicated a need for a broader theoretical framework, incorporating aspects of the respondents' life situation and personal experience which would be relevant to the specific type of health behaviour under study.;"AIR POLLUTION; HEALTH BEHAVIOR; TRAFFIC INTENSITY; MOTOR VEHICLE EXHAUST; OUTDOOR ACTIVITY; HEALTH BELIEF MODEL; HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL";"Adult; Aged; Air Pollution; Automobile Driving; Denmark; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Health Behavior; Human; Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Lung Diseases; Male; Middle Age; Questionnaires; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Vehicle Emissions; Denmark, Copenhagen; air pollution; automobile pollution; health behaviour; outdoor activity; pollution notification; questionnaire data; survey data; theoretical framework; urban area; adult; aged; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; article; behavior; car driving; denmark; experience; health; health status; human; lung disease; major clinical study; motor vehicle; pollution; questionnaire; smog";;1;1;0;1;0;1;Camille
129;Integrating travel behavior with land use regression to estimate dynamic air pollution exposure in Hong Kong;"Tang, R; Tian, LW; Thach, TQ; Tsui, TH; Brauer, M; Lee, M; Allen, R; Yuchi, W; Lai, PC; Wong, P; Barratt, B";Background: Epidemiological studies typically use subjects' residential address to estimate individuals' air pollution exposure. However, in reality this exposure is rarely static as people move from home to work/study locations and commute during the day. Integrating mobility and time-activity data may reduce errors and biases, thereby improving estimates of health risks. Objectives: To incorporate land use regression with movement and building infiltration data to estimate time-weighted air pollution exposures stratified by age, sex, and employment status for population subgroups in Hong Kong. Methods: A large population-representative survey (N = 89,385) was used to characterize travel behavior, and derive time-activity pattern for each subject. Infiltration factors calculated from indoor/outdoor monitoring campaigns were used to estimate micro-environmental concentrations. We evaluated dynamic and static (residential location-only) exposures in a staged modeling approach to quantify effects of each component. Results: Higher levels of exposures were found for working adults and students due to increased mobility. Compared to subjects aged 65 or older, exposures to PM2.5, BC, and NO2 were 13%, 39% and 14% higher, respectively for subjects aged below 18, and 3%, 18% and 11% higher, respectively for working adults. Exposures of females were approximately 4% lower than those of males. Dynamic exposures were around 20% lower than ambient exposures at residential addresses. Conclusions: The incorporation of infiltration and mobility increased heterogeneity in population exposure and allowed identification of highly exposed groups. The use of ambient concentrations may lead to exposure misclassification which introduces bias, resulting in lower effect estimates than 'true' exposures.;"Air pollution; Dynamic exposure; Land use regression; Exposure assessment; Travel behavior; Time-activity";"Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Travel; China; Hong Kong; Air pollution; Health risks; Housing; Population statistics; Air pollution exposures; Dynamic exposure; Environmental concentration; Epidemiological studies; Exposure assessment; Exposure misclassification; Land use regression; Travel behaviors; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; estimation method; health risk; land use; pollution exposure; survey; travel behavior; adult; age; aged; air monitoring; air pollution; ambient air; Article; building; employment status; environmental exposure; female; Hong Kong; human; land use; male; particulate matter; population research; priority journal; residential area; sex; sex difference; travel; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; middle aged; statistics and numerical data; Land use";"PERSONAL EXPOSURE; PARTICULATE MATTER; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; HEALTH IMPACT; OUTDOOR; POLLUTANTS; AMBIENT; PM2.5; INDOOR; HETEROGENEITY";0;0;0;0;0;0;Camille
131;Exposure and perception of PM2.5 pollution on the mental stress of pregnant women;"Li J.; Huang L.; Han B.; van der Kuijp T.J.; Xia Y.; Chen K.";Prenatal exposure to ambient PM2.5 has been proved to be related to pregnant women's physical health and birth outcomes. However, the damage from air pollution on pregnant women's mental health has not been fully discussed. A case-control study was conducted to evaluate the effects of PM2.5 exposure and risk perception on the mental stress of pregnant women. A total of 605 pregnant women, including 403 high symptoms of stress cases and 202 matched controls, were recruited from January 2018 to December 2018 in Nanjing, among which 313 high symptoms of stress cases and 144 matched controls were included in the analysis. Meaningfully high symptoms of anxiety were defined with a score of 6 points or greater on the phobic anxiety subscale of the Crown-Crisp index. We found that the PM2.5 effect perceived by the case group was significantly higher than the control group, and the PM2.5 exposure of the case group was also significantly higher than that of the control group. Binary logistic regression showed that for each increase in unit of PM2.5 exposure, the risk of pregnant women suffering from high mental stress increased by 13.76% (95 %CI: 8.2619.53%). Through path analysis modeling, we found that in the case group, perceived indoor attributions not only had a direct impact on mental stress (p < 0.001), but also played a key mediating role in the impact of average daily dose of PM2.5 on mental stress (p < 0.001). The high level of mental stress is not only affected by objective exposure, but also by subjective perceptions in the case group. Considering the significant effect of PM2.5 exposure on mental stress, pregnant women are recommended to spend appropriate amounts of time outdoors during clean air days. In addition, the mediating role of risk perception cannot be ignored. It is necessary to reassure pregnant women not to become overly concerned about the risk of PM2.5 pollution and reduce their psychological burden. © 2021 The Authors;"Mental stress; PM<sub>2.5</sub>; Pregnant women; Risk perception";"Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Case-Control Studies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Particulate Matter; Perception; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; Pollution control; Regression analysis; Ambients; Control groups; Matched controls; Mediating roles; Mental health; Mental stress; Physical health; PM$-2.5$; Pregnant woman; Prenatal exposure; mental health; particulate matter; pollution exposure; pregnancy; risk perception; symptom; womens health; adult; air pollution; anxiety; Article; Beck Anxiety Inventory; breathing rate; case control study; confirmatory factor analysis; controlled study; depression; disease simulation; environmental exposure; environmental factor; exploratory factor analysis; female; headache; human; indoor air pollution; interview; job stress; Likert scale; major clinical study; mental health; mental stress; oxidative stress; particulate matter 2.5; path analysis; perception; phobia; physical activity; PM2.5 exposure; pollution; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; questionnaire; risk factor; risk perception; sleep disordered breathing; smoking; work environment; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; particulate matter; perception; pregnant woman; Risk perception";;1;0;0;1;0;1;Camille
143;Influence of travel behaviour and daily mobility on exposure to traffic-related air pollution;"Shekarrizfard, M; Minet, L; Miller, E; Yusuf, B; Weichenthal, S; Hatzopoulou, M";This study evaluates the daily exposure of urban residents across various commuting modes and destinations by intersecting data from a travel survey with exposure surfaces for ultrafine particles and black carbon, in Toronto, Canada. We demonstrate that exposure misclassification is bound to arise when we approximate daily exposure with the concentration at the home location. We also identify potential inequities in the distribution of exposure to traffic-related air pollution whereby those who are mostly responsible for the generation of traffic-related air pollution (drivers and passengers) are exposed the least while active commuters and transit riders, are exposed the most.;"Traffic; Air pollution; Exposure; Mobility; Land-use regression; Ultrafine particles; Black carbon";"Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Canada; Environmental Exposure; Particulate Matter; Soot; Vehicle Emissions; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto; black carbon; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; concentration (composition); land use; pollution exposure; regression analysis; traffic emission; adult; Article; Canada; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; comparative study; driver; dust exposure; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; female; home; human; male; middle aged; mobilization; particulate matter; priority journal; toxic concentration; traffic pollution; travel; urban population; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; soot; toxicity";HEALTH;0;0;0;0;0;0;Camille
167;The public perceptions and willingness to pay: from the perspective of the smog crisis in China;"Sun, CW; Yuan, X; Xu, ML";The deteriorating air quality, which is linked to human actions related to energy resources, has become an urgent global problem. China's air pollution has reached the hazardous level since 2000s. In consideration of the serious health and social problems, residential demand for clean air is increasing. This paper applies the Contingent Valuation method to estimate public's willingness to pay (WTP) for reducing air pollution in the urban area of China. Open-ended scenarios through face-to-face surveys are used to elicit public's WTP. The Two-Part model is employed for the estimation: the probit model is used to estimate the probability of respondents who have positive WTP values, and the interval regression model is employed to estimate the specific WTP level of those with nonzero WTP values. The results show that nearly 90% of the respondents are willing to pay for reducing air pollution, and the average amount of WTP per individual is 382.6RMB per year. Household income is found to be positively correlated with people's WTP, and those who trust the government are more willing to share the cost of reducing air pollution. This study recommends designing some effective mechanisms to tap the potentially available source of money for smog mitigation and improving the transparency of smog governance to enhance the government credibility as solutions to cope with smog crisis.

171;Air quality, human behavior and urban park visit: A case study in Beijing;"Jiang, YQ; Huang, GL; Fisher, B";Parks provide critical ecosystem services to urban residents. Many of these services can only be realized when people visit parks. Particulate matter exposure poses negative health impacts and may turn the health benefits brought by park visits into health risks. This tradeoff relationship is heavily moderated by how individuals behave under varying ambient air quality conditions. While there is a growing evidence base regarding the benefits brought by urban parks, little is known about how people adjust their park visitation to air pollution. Here we use two approaches to understand if air quality affects urban park visits in Beijing: a stated preference survey on social media and a year-long faceto-face survey in a neighborhood park. Quantile regression and ANOVA analysis were used. We found particulate pollution has a negative impact on the maximum number of visits a park may receive. A significant drop occurred when the pollution level changed from moderate to heavy pollution. Therefore, the ecosystem services provided by parks are not fully realized due to the reduced number of visits caused by air pollution. Second, regardless of how poor air quality is, a proportion of people (41-64%) put themselves at exposure risk to enjoy the benefits brought by parks. Third, the inconsistency between behavior and intention signals people are less protected from the potential adverse health impacts of poor air quality than they think. Future study should look into what factors may cause the divergence between people's intentions and behaviors. Understandings on this issue will contribute to design better guidance and incentives to reduce the adverse health cost of air pollution exposure from park visitation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

174;Roles of socio-physical environments on air quality control policy with respect to knowledge, attitude and intention;"Nguyen, KLP; Chuang, YH; Yu, RF; Chen, CY; Chen, HW";Human behavior altered in different socioeconomic conditions is the main contributor to deteriorating air quality, therefore changing the behavior is the goal of air policies. In this study, we propose an integrated framework to figure out the roles of socio-physical environments in promoting air quality control policies through behavioral perspectives. The study selects Changhua County in Central Taiwan, composed of 26 cities and townships, as a case study to investigate the impacts of social and economic factors and the air quality on individual's knowledge, attitude and behavioral intention. The socioeconomic and environmental factors are collected from Taiwanese official information, while the knowledge, attitude, and intention toward the policies are obtained through questionnaires. Subsequently, multivariate analysis techniques including principal component analysis and redundancy analysis are utilized to simultaneously identify the causal relationships between socio-physical environments and the knowledge, attitude, and intention in different townships. Our findings suggest that individual's knowledge, attitude, and intention toward the air polices cannot be raised simply in commensurate with the growth of the economy and the deterioration of air quality. Indeed, people living in highly urbanized regions and being well-educated, particularly in Changhua City, are less willing to take actions for air quality improvement although they are susceptible to environmental risks. On the contrary, people close to nature have more environmental knowledge, positive attitudes and more intentions to improve the air quality. The finding results will be beneficial to authorities in each city/township to organize environmental education plans corresponding to their socioeconomic conditions and behavioral patterns.

190;The role of personal air pollution sensors and smartphone technology in changing travel behaviour;"Haddad, H; de Nazelle, A";Exposure to air pollution is affected by human behaviour, and has consequences for individual and collective health. One way to lessen the health effects of air pollution is to change personal travel behaviour with the help of new information, communication and sensing technologies. Our social research tracked the experiences of participants, air quality and technology enthusiasts, based in London who financially contributed to participate in an early-stage technical trial of a new air pollution sensor and app providing individuals with air pollution information (specifically levels of NO2 and VOCs). This paper reports the results of a before and after survey (returning respondents n=22) and 12 in-depth interviews with individuals who took part in the beta test of the sensor and phone app. The survey results show that travel-related behaviours and attitudes relevant to air pollution did not change after using the technology. In contrast, expectations of technology performance and the extent it would influence behaviours were significantly lower after the trial than before. Further exploration during semi-structured interviews found that the participants, given their already high level of engagement with the topic, felt the capacity for immediate individual behaviour change was limited. As well as time and practical constraints, most people in this sample felt they were already doing what they could to avoid high levels of air pollution in their daily lives. Despite this, they had some recommendations to improve the app, such as the inclusion of real-time and historic maps, and the ability to make self and other comparisons. Overwhelmingly, people saw a broader role for the technology to engage the public with air pollution through raising awareness, and harnessing citizen science to collect diverse reliable data to inform policy and influence local policymakers to reduce air pollution levels.;;;"PLANNED BEHAVIOR; CITIZEN SCIENCE; SELF-IDENTITY; CONSERVATION; MODELS; IMPACT; TOOL";1;1;1;0;0;1;Camille
224;An assessment of perceptions of air quality surrounding the implementation of a traffic-reduction measure in a local urban environment;"Schmitz, S; Weiand, L; Becker, S; Niehoff, N; Schwartzbach, F; von Schneidemesser, E";Poor air quality remains a major environmental and health risk in Europe, despite improvements over the last few decades. Consistent exceedances of the nitrogen dioxide air quality limit values at a roadside monitoring station in Potsdam, owing to heavy local and commuter individual motorized traffic, prompted the city administration to implement a trial traffic measure aimed at reducing motorized traffic to improve air quality. This study analysed data (n = 3553) from a questionnaire carried out prior to the implementation of the trial traffic measure. This research provides a case-study to contribute to the understanding of general determinants of air quality perceptions, and policy-relevant information regarding how citizens perceive air quality in the context of a 'hard' policy measure. A subset of variables was used to build an ordinal logistic regression model to assess the explanatory power for air quality perceptions. Gender, perceived health status, level of concern for air quality, level of concern for climate change, and the desire for greater access to information regarding air quality were factors found to be significant in their explanatory power of perceptions of air quality. The results are discussed in the broader policy context of attempts to improve air quality in urban environments.;"Air quality; Perception; Sustainable urban transport; Spatial analysis; Local; Transdisciplinary";"Climate change; Health risks; Nitrogen oxides; Regression analysis; Sensory perception; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Environmental and health risks; Local; Ordinal logistic regression; Quality perceptions; Roadside monitoring station; Spatial analysis; Transdisciplinary; Urban transport; Air quality";"POLLUTION; HEALTH; BEHAVIOR";1;0;1;0;0;1;Camille

255;Exposure to online news about air pollution and public trust in regulators in China: a moderated mediation analysis of perceived risk and perceived news credibility;Huang, Q;Public trust in regulators is critical to the effective management of environmental risks. This study proposes a model to explicate how people's online news exposure, perceived risk, and perceived news credibility influence their trust in regulators concerning the issue of air pollution in China. An online survey showed that perceived risk fully mediated the relationship between online news exposure and trust in regulators. Through moderating the association between online news exposure and perceived risk, perceived news credibility also moderated the indirect effect: the negative indirect effect of online news exposure on trust in regulators via perceived risk was stronger when the level of perceived news credibility was high than when it was low. The results suggest that online news that attempts to make the public more conscious of air pollution hazards reduces public trust in regulators, especially when people perceive the news as highly credible. News media are supposed to inform the public of the issue and thus help air pollution management. However, the findings alert us that the amplification of public risk perception resulting from frequent online news exposure and the subsequent decline in public trust in regulators might impede the effective regulation of air pollution.;"Online news exposure; perceived risk; perceived news credibility; trust in regulators; air pollution";;;1;0;1;0;0;1;Camille
289;Ambient air pollution perception and coping behaviour among hikers;Wang, WC;Air pollution is becoming a global issue affecting many places around the world. In recent years, issues regarding air quality, leisure-time physical activity and tourists' behavioural intentions have been of considerable concern. This study aims to explore the impact of air pollution on hikers' hiking behaviour based on the stress coping theory and also examine the differences of hikers from two locations within different air quality. On-site questionnaire survey was conducted to understand hikers' perceptions of air pollution, stress induced by air pollution, and coping behaviours. Overall, 400 questionnaires were completed, of which 336 were valid. Results of independent t-test indicated that although the air quality of Xiangshan was better than Shoushan for long periods of time, Xiangshan hikers were more likely to use absolute substitution than Shoushan hikers when facing air pollution. Moreover, based on the results of the regression analysis, perception of air pollution and stress associated with air pollution were determined to be correlated with coping behaviours. Behavioural coping strategies rather than cognitive coping strategies were employed when hikers encountered air pollution. Finally, managerial implications and suggestions for future research were proposed based on the results.;"Outdoor recreation; air quality; coping strategy; hiking; tourists";"China; Jiangxi; Xiangshan; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; perception; questionnaire survey; tourist behavior";"TIME PHYSICAL INACTIVITY; OUTDOOR RECREATION; ASSOCIATION; SUBSTITUTABILITY; SUBSTITUTION; TOURISM; QUALITY; ANGLERS; ALERTS; HEALTH";1;1;0;0;0;1;Camille
302;When Do Governments Support Common Goods for Health? Four Cases on Surveillance, Traffic Congestion, Road Safety, and Air Pollution;"Bump, JB; Reddiar, SK; Soucat, A";Common goods such as air, water, climate, and other resources shared by all humanity are under increasing pressure from growing population and advancing globalization of the world economy. Safeguarding these resources is generally considered a government responsibility, as common goods are vulnerable to market failure. However, governments do not always fulfill this role, and face many challenges in doing so. This observation-that governments only sometimes address common goods problems-informs the central question of this paper: when do governments act in support of common goods? We structure our inquiry using a framework derived from three theories of agenda setting, emphasizing problem perception, the role of actors and collective action patterns, strategies and policies, and catalyzing circumstances. We used a poll of experts to identify important common goods for health: disease surveillance, environmental protection, and accountability. We then chose four historical cases for analysis: the establishment of the Epidemic Intelligence Service in the US, transport planning in London, road safety in Argentina, and air quality control in urban India. Our analysis of the collective evidence of these cases suggests that decisions to advance government action on common goods require a concisely articulated problem, a well-defined strategy for addressing the problem, and leadership backed by at least a few important groups willing to cooperate. Our cases reveal a variety of collective action patterns, suggesting that there are many routes to success. We consider that the timing of an intervention in support of common goods depends on favorable circumstances, which can include a catalyzing event but does not necessarily require one.;"collective action; common goods; global health history; government failure; public health";"Air Pollution; Argentina; Government Programs; Humans; India; London; Population Surveillance; Safety; Social Justice; United States; adverse event; air pollution; Argentina; England; government; health survey; human; India; legislation and jurisprudence; procedures; safety; social justice; United States";"DISEASE; TIME; EPIDEMIC; FAILURE";0;0;1;0;1;1;Camille
305;Singapore's willingness to pay for mitigation of transboundary forest-fire haze from Indonesia;"Lin, Y; Wijedasa, LS; Chisholm, RA";Haze pollution over the past four decades in Southeast Asia is mainly a result of forest and peatland fires in Indonesia. The economic impacts of haze include adverse health effects and disruption to transport and tourism. Previous studies have used a variety of approaches to assess the economic impacts of haze and the forest fires more generally. But no study has used contingent valuation to assess non-market impacts of haze on individuals. Here we apply contingent valuation to estimate impacts of haze on Singapore, one of most severely affected countries. We used a double-bounded dichotomous-choice survey design and the Kaplan-Meier-Turnbull method to infer the distribution of Singaporeans' willingness to pay (WTP) for haze mitigation. Our estimate of mean individual WTP was 0.97% of annual income (n = 390). To calculate total national WTP, we stratified by income, the demographic variable most strongly related to individual WTP. The total WTP estimate was $643.5 million per year (95% CI [$527.7 million, $765.0 million]). This estimate is comparable in magnitude to previously estimated impacts of Indonesia's fires and also to the estimated costs of peatland protection and restoration. We recommend that our results be incorporated into future cost-benefit analyses of the fires and mitigation strategies.;"willingness to pay; haze; Indonesian forest fires; peatlands; contingent valuation";"Indonesia; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Deforestation; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Fire hazards; Fires; Resource valuation; Wetlands; Contingent valuations; Forest fires; haze; Peat land; Willingness to pay; contingent valuation; cost analysis; cost-benefit analysis; economic impact; environmental economics; environmental protection; forest fire; haze; peatland; survey design; transboundary pollution; willingness to pay; Cost benefit analysis";"CENTRAL KALIMANTAN; AIR-POLLUTION; SOUTHEAST-ASIA; PEAT FIRES; SMOKE HAZE; QUALITY; MORTALITY";0;0;1;0;0;1;Camille
309;Public perceptions of air pollution and its health impacts in Greater Kuala Lumpur;"Chang, FJ; Ashfold, MJ";"Air pollution is a globally pervasive health hazard but the risks it poses can be overlooked by the public. To explore the significance of this problem in Greater Kuala Lumpur (KL), Malaysia, we conducted a survey of the public (n = 165). We found (1) an appreciation for the importance of motor vehicles as a source of air pollution; (2) little reported engagement with the official Air Pollution Index (API); (3) a lack of awareness of the long-term health effects of air pollution and (4) reports of a substantial impact of air pollution on day-to-day life. While our survey sample is not representative of the population of Greater KL, our findings are broadly consistent with those of others and underscore a need for improved communication to the public of risks posed by air pollution. Tightened standards underlying the Malaysian API and improved dissemination of real-time air quality updates may be important opportunities to achieve this.";"air pollution; public perception; health risk; Malaysia; Greater Kuala Lumpur";;;1;0;0;0;0;1;Camille
369;RETRACTED: Nationwide response to air pollution: Environmental behavior model based on self-identity and social identity process (Retracted Article);"Huang, LP; Ou, J; Gao, J";Environmental problems such as air pollution are global, and are created by human collective behavior. Accordingly, their remedies call for residents to transform their Pro-environmental behavior (PEB) from individual level to collective level. Based on the perspective of self-identity process and social identity process, this research proposes a comprehensive model by integrating elements from theory of planned behavior (TPB), self-identity theory and social identity theory. To assess the model, we have designed questionnaire and collected the survey data using Questionnaire Star (a professional data platform in China). The data were analyzed using both structural equation model (AMOS) and regression analysis (SPSS). It is found that there exist interactions between individual and collective factors, and their positive influence on PEB of the individuals with varying strengths. The broader view of the model can enhance our understanding regarding the intricate internal structure of ecological behavior, and it can also offer valuable reference when formulating environmental policies and education strategies.;"Self-identity process; social identity process; individual Pro-environmental behavior; collective Pro-environmental behavior";;"COLLECTIVE EFFICACY; GREEN; ANTECEDENTS; INTENTIONS; AGENCY";0;0;0;0;0;0;Camille
414;Associations between Parents' Perceived Air Quality in Homes and Health among Children in Nanjing, China;"Qian, H; Zheng, XH; Zhang, M; Weschler, L; Sundell, J";The increasing prevalence of respiratory diseases in Chinese children has focused attention on indoor environmental quality. We investigated associations between perceived air quality in domestic environments and children's allergic diseases with a questionnaire survey study. A total of 4017 children aged 1-8 years old from 23 kindergartens in urban, suburban and industrial areas in Nanjing were randomly recruited for this study. Parents' perceived odors, including stuffy odor, unpleasant odor, pungent odor, moldy odor, humid air and dry air were found to be associated with asthma, wheeze, dry cough and rhinitis (P < 0.05). Both perceived dry and humid air were found to be positively associated with dampness indices, and we present evidence that the sensation of dryness may not be due to the actual indoor relative humidity, but rather to indoor air irritants. Parents' perception of odors and relative humidity may be indicators of environment pollutants, which are likely the real factors associated with children's allergic diseases.;;"Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Female; Health Status; Humans; Humidity; Hypersensitivity; Infant; Male; Odorants; Parents; Perception; Prevalence; Surveys and Questionnaires; fragrance; air pollutant; air quality; Article; asthma; child; child health; China; controlled study; coughing; dry mass; female; home environment; human; humidity; industrial area; male; odor; respiratory tract allergy; rhinitis; urban area; wheezing; child; health status; hypersensitivity; indoor air pollution; infant; parent; perception; preschool child; prevalence; psychology; questionnaire";"ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO-SMOKE; INDOOR-AIR; ALLERGIC SYMPTOMS; BUILDING CHARACTERISTICS; RESPIRATORY HEALTH; VENTILATION RATES; VOC EMISSIONS; BIRTH-COHORT; HOUSE-DUST; ASTHMA";1;0;0;1;0;1;Camille
453;UNINTENDED BENEFITS: LEADERSHIP SKILLS AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGE AMONG GUATEMALAN FIELDWORKERS EMPLOYED IN A LONGITUDINAL HOUSEHOLD AIR POLLUTION STUDY;"Kuo, D; Thompson, LM; Lee, A; Romero, C; Smith, KR";The RESPIRE and CRECER studies measured the effects of reduced household air pollution (HAP) from wood-fired cookstoves on respiratory health in rural highland Guatemala. This article examines behavior change and leadership skill development in local community members who were hired as fieldworkers to assist with research. Fieldworkers administered household questionnaires, shared functions similar to community health workers, and bridged health resources to communities. A mixed-methods design for data collection (in-depth interviews, focus groups, impact drawings, knowledge questionnaire, and retrospective pre-test) was used. Purposive sampling included 10 fieldworkers and 13 local service providers. Fieldworkers showed an increase in knowledge, positive attitudes, and practices around HAP. They developed new technical, interpersonal, and leadership skills. Fieldworkers played a crucial role in building confianza (trust) with the community, bridging resources, and improving outside researchers' relationships with locals. Recommendations for future researchers include inclusion of additional training courses and adoption of community participatory approaches.;;"Adult; Air Pollution, Indoor; Carbon Monoxide; Community Health Workers; Cooking; Female; Guatemala; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Promotion; Humans; Leadership; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Power (Psychology); Research Personnel; Steam Bath; carbon monoxide; adult; article; attitude to health; behavior; cooking; female; Guatemala; health auxiliary; health promotion; human; indoor air pollution; leadership; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; personnel; sauna";"COMMUNITY-HEALTH WORKERS; PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; EMPOWERMENT THEORY; WOMEN; YOUTH; EDUCATION; EXPOSURE; CHILDREN";1;1;0;1;0;1;Camille
518;Factors affecting parents perception on air quality-from the individual to the community level;"Guo Y.; Liu F.; Lu Y.; Mao Z.; Lu H.; Wu Y.; Chu Y.; Yu L.; Liu Y.; Ren M.; Li N.; Chen X.; Xiang H.";"The perception of air quality significantly affects the acceptance of the public of the governments environmental policies. The aim of this research is to explore the relationship between the perception of the air quality of parents and scientific monitoring data and to analyze the factors that affect parents perceptions. Scientific data of air quality were obtained from Wuhans environmental condition reports. One thousand parents were investigated for their knowledge and perception of air quality. Scientific data show that the air quality of Wuhan follows an improving trend in general, while most participants believed that the air quality of Wuhan has deteriorated, which indicates a significant difference between public perception and reality. On the individual level, respondents with an age of 40 or above (40 or above: OR = 3.252; 95% CI: 1.170-9.040), a higher educational level (college and above: OR = 7.598; 95% CI: 2.244-25.732) or children with poor healthy conditions (poor: OR = 6.864; 95% CI: 2.212-21.302) have much more negative perception of air quality. On the community level, industrial facilities, vehicles and city construction have major effects on parents perception of air quality. Our investigation provides baseline information for environmental policy researchers and makers regarding the publics perception and expectation of air quality and the benefits to the environmental policy completing and enforcing. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.";"Air quality; Community level; Factors; Individual level; Perceived";"Adolescent; Adult; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Policy; Female; Humans; Male; Parents; Perception; Residence Characteristics; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; China; Hubei; Wuhan; air quality; environmental conditions; environmental policy; perception; adult; air quality; child; college; controlled study; environmental planning; expectation; human; human experiment; monitoring; perception; scientist; adolescent; air pollution; China; city; demography; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; female; male; parent; questionnaire; young adult";;1;0;0;1;0;1;Camille
547;Development and Validation of the Haze Risk Perception Scale and Influencing Factor Scale-A Study Based on College Students in Beijing;"Zhang, YB; Chen, JW; Wei, XF; Wu, X";"Although Beijing's air quality has improved, there is still a long way to go for haze governance. In order to understand haze risk perception and related influencing factors among college students in Beijing, we developed and verified two scales, with college students as the survey object, and analyzed the theoretical framework and realistic level of haze risk perception and influencing factors through empirical research. We showed that the reliability and validity of the two scales are excellent, and they can be used as a powerful tool to measure college students' perception of haze. The haze risk perception scale (HRPS) is divided into four dimensions. The degrees of perception ranked from high to low are: direct consequences perception, indirect consequences perception, risk responsibility perception and risk source perception. The haze risk perception influencing factor scale (HRPIFS) is divided into three dimensions. The degrees of influence ranked from high to low are: personal emotion, media communication and government policy; the three influencing factors all have a significant positive correlation to overall haze risk perception, but personal emotions and media communication are only significantly related to the three dimensions of direct consequence perception, indirect consequence perception and risk source perception. Government policy is only significantly related to the three dimensions of direct consequence perception, indirect consequence perception and risk liability perception. This paper proves the important role of media in haze risk perception and puts forward some policy suggestions to guide the public to form a rational risk perception. These findings can help improve theoretical and practical research related to haze risk.";"haze; risk perception; influencing factors; scale; college students in Beijing";"Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Government; Humans; Perception; Reproducibility of Results; Students; Beijing [China]; China; air quality; haze; risk perception; student; article; China; college student; conceptual framework; emotion; empirical research; government; haze; human; human experiment; perception; reliability; responsibility; risk perception; theoretical study; validation process; validity; air pollutant; air pollution; China; reproducibility; student";"RESPONSIBILITY; POLLUTION; CHINA; ATTRIBUTION; RESPONSES; EXPOSURE; PM2.5; TRUST; CITY";1;0;1;0;0;1;Camille
580;Perception of Risks from Wood Combustion and Traffic Induced Air Pollution: Evidence from Northern Europe;"Orru, K; Tiittanen, P; Ung-Lanki, S; Orru, H; Lanki, T";The health effects of particulate matter, increasing emissions from transportation and requisites for making use of biofuels brings up the need to understand how individuals interpret air-pollution-related risks from wood burning and traffic. We aim to clarify the extent to which perceived risks from road-traffic and wood-smoke can be explained by the individual psychological, social status-related and socio-institutional factors in the case of two Northern European countries, Finland and Estonia. This approach elucidates which of the closely intertwined factors shape the perception of risks from air pollution in different socio-institutional contexts and for different air pollution sources. The study uses data from cross-sectional population surveys conducted among 1112 Finnish and 1000 Estonian residents about environmental health risk perception and coping. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that in both countries' cases, the perceived personal and general risk from traffic exhaust and wood-smoke can be explained by the perception of exposure to pollution and, also, by the level of knowledge of, the worry about and the possible symptoms from environmental health factors. The perceived vulnerability due to poor health further sensitises individuals towards risks from air pollution. Higher trust towards state institutions in guaranteeing a healthy living environment and greater perceived openness about the risks may attenuate the feelings of vulnerability to air pollution risks in Finland compared to Estonia. The ingrained appeal for wood burning may explain the higher acceptance of exhausts from wood-burning compared to traffic. This may lead to scant support for measures to reduce emissions from wood combustion.;"perceived risk; traffic exhaust; wood-smoke; cardio-vascular disease; Northern Europe";"Air; Estonia; Europe; Finland; Niger [West Africa]; Northern Europe; regression analysis";"ENVIRONMENTAL RISK; HEALTH; QUALITY; ANNOYANCE; EXPERIENCE; ESTONIA; IMPACT";1;0;0;1;0;1;Camille
603;The Effects of Opening Windows Behavior on Indoor Air Quality of a Newly Decorated Office Building;"Shen, XH; Li, NP; Fan, XJ; Wu, YL; Ke, YZ";In the newly decorated office premises, the architectural decoration material will release much polluted gas, thus the IAQ is highly concerned. Natural ventilation through open windows can influence the IAQ. To study the effects of opening windows on the indoor air quality of newly decorated office premises, we choose several newly decorated offices in a commercial building in Changsha, a city in hot summer and cold winter region of China, as the study object. The 4 contrastive research schemes in the winter are adopted to acquire the results. Field-testing and air sampling methods were taken respectively to the 4 schemes to measure the concentrations of the main pollution composition such as formaldehyde, ammonia, benzene and TVOC in the offices. Meanwhile, relevant questionnaire surveys towards the four schemes were taken to the staff in the offices. We have synthesized and analyzed the IAQ condition of the 4 research schemes from the results of the tests and surveys. The result of the study shows that: the IAQ is the worst and cannot come up to the national standard when closing windows all day long in the newly decorated offices. Also some staff have a series of adverse reactions working in the work environment for a long time. All the other three schemes can improve the IAQ differently, and the scheme that opening windows all day long can improve the IAQ the best. Meanwhile, people can feel the change of IAQ effected by the 3 ventilation schemes if he/she is working for a long time in the offices.;"Newly decorated office premises; Indoor air quality (IAQ); Opening windows behavior";;;1;1;0;0;0;1;Camille
609;A cross-sectional study on determinants of indoor air pollution and its perceived impact among the residents of urban field practice area of AMCH, Salem, Tamil Nadu;"Priyadarsini, SP; Ibrahim, RM; Somasundaram, VM; Nayeem, RA; Balasubramanian, R";Background: Over the past 20 years. indoor air pollution (IAP) has received much attention as the quality of the indoor air is affected a lot. IAP means the presence of substances which are redundant in the indoor air at concentrations toxic to health. Very few studies have addressed the determinants of indoor air pollutants in places like urban slum areas in Tamil Nadu. To reduce this research gap, this study has been undertaken. Aim: To study the determinants of IAP and its perceived impact on health. Settings and Design: This was a community-based cross-sectional study. Complete information from 440 households consisting of 1606 individuals was collected through a semi-structured questionnaire. Materials and Methods: Residents of an urban field practice area of Annapoorana Medical College and Hospitals (AMCH) were the study participants. The study period was from April 19 to March 2020. The study area was an urban field practice area around Department of Community Medicine, Karungalpatty, AMCH. Frequency, proportions. and Spearman test were used to find out the significance between various household environmental conditions and the respiratory diseases using Epi Info software. Results: Results showed that 52.3% of the participants were using incense sticks at home in the evening during pooja and 17.7% of the houses were using mosquito coil in the evening and at night. Also, 29.5% houses reported overcrowding and 66.4% of the houses were not having chimney or exhaust. Results also showed that 71.4% households were practicing opening their windows while cooking. One hundred and fifty-two (34.5%) female respondents had perceived the symptoms like dizziness (12.3%), eye irritation (10.2%), difficulty in breathing (4.5%), dry cough (3.06%), running nose (1.4%), and nasal congestion (1.1%) due to IAP. Among under-five respondents, 1.6% reported having acute respiratory infections in the last 15 days and 10.5% reported the same in the last 1 year 10.5%.;"Determinants; indoor air pollution; respiratory infections";;CHILDREN;0;0;0;1;0;1;Camille
610;Propensity to Migrate and Willingness to Pay Related to Air Pollution among Different Populations in Wuhan, China;"Chu, YY; Liu, YS; Lu, YN; Yu, LC; Lu, HS; Guo, YL; Liu, FF; Wu, YY; Mao, ZF; Ren, M; Li, N; Chen, X; Xiang, H";"Objective: To understand parents' propensity to migrate and willingness to pay with respect to outdoor air pollution, and to explore related affecting factors. Methods: This study used a convenience sample and subjects were collected from a community in Wuchang District and Children's Hospital of Wuhan, respectively. A designed questionnaire was used for this study. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to analyze the relationship between parents' individual and familial characteristics and related behavioral intensions to air quality improvement. Statistical analysis was done with SAS 9.1. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 865 subjects (response rate = 86.5%). The number of people with migrant intent was 150(36.4%) from hospital group, and 139(30.7%) from community group. In the hospital group, subjects with higher knowledge of air quality (OR = 6.268, p < 0.05) and higher average annual household income (AAHI), which was equal or more than 50,000 Yuan (OR = 2.045, p < 0.01), were found to be more intent to migrate. AAHI (OR = 1.939, p < 0.05) was also the affecting factor in the community group correspondingly. Those willing to pay for air quality improvement included 297 people (72.1%) from the hospital group and 333 people (73.5%) from the community group, and affecting factors was the public responsibility for air quality improvement (hospital group: OR = 3.380, p < 0.01; community group: OR = 4.436, p < 0.01). Conclusions: This study indicated high tendency of propensity to migrate for avoiding poor air condition and willingness to pay to improve air quality in Wuhan. Local governments should pay more attention to parents' knowledge of air pollution and attitudes towards government management of air quality, especially those willing to migrate.";"Air pollution; Propensity to migrate; Willingness to pay; Income; Responsibility";"China; Hubei; Wuhan; Air pollution; Hospitals; Pollution; Regression analysis; Surveys; Air quality improvement; Government management; Income; Logistic regression models; Outdoor air pollution; Propensity to migrate; Responsibility; Willingness to pay; atmospheric pollution; hospital sector; household income; public attitude; regression analysis; state role; willingness to pay; Air quality";"CONTINGENT VALUATION; RESPIRATORY HEALTH; QUALITY; SHANGHAI; BEHAVIOR; PERCEPTION; RESIDENTS; WORKERS; RISK";0;1;1;0;0;1;Camille
659;Environmental conflicts in the South Durban Basin: Integrating residents' perceptions and concerns resulting from air pollution;Jaggernath, J;With a complex mix of large scale industries and major transport networks, the South Durban Basin (SDB) residential area has been subjected to a considerable amount of environmental impacts and conflicts. A major concern in the area is the effects of air pollution on human health and ecology that are caused by the emissions of unacceptable levels of toxins, chemical waste and a large content of sulphur dioxide, which are characteristic of industrial processes and activities. Perceptions regarding environmental conflicts in the area were recorded by eliciting residents' concerns. Fieldwork in the form of questionnaires was undertaken. These were administered to 200 households in Merebank and Wentworth in the SDB to determine residents' knowledge, perceptions and concerns about industrial activities and potential impacts. This paper therefore explores residents' perceptions of environmental impacts and highlights the key issues which contribute to community conflicts - including those conflicts related to government, employment, race and community health.;;;;1;0;0;0;0;1;Camille
702;The role of air quality in perception of health of the local population;"Valenti? D.; Mi?ovi? V.; Kolari? B.; Brn?i? N.; Ljubotina A.";The research aim was to investigate and establish the perception of health among population groups with different number of industrial polluters in their living environment. Namely, the Kostrena living area (3250 inhabitants) is situated near big industrial pollutant producers: INA oil refinery Urinj, thermo power plant Rijeka, shipyard »Viktor Lenac«, while in Crikvenica living area such pollutant producers do not exist. In this research 146 subjects from Kostrena participated (74 men and 72 women with age average 40.8, SD 9.2 years), and 157 subjects from Crikvenica area (79 men and 78 women with age average 39.4, SD 10.1 years). The perception of health was measured by the means of SF-36 questionnaire variables. Lung function (FEV1, FVC, FEV 25/75, PEF), cardiovascular function (systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure, heart rate were also measured, including body proporton measures by the means of waste and hip circumference and silhouette test, in order to establish the eventual objective physical health parametar difference among examined population groups. Subjects from Kostrena perceived their general health, mental health, and vitality worse than subjects from Crikvenica. Group from Kostrena felt themself more limited in their roles due to emotional problems, perceiving more pain than group from Crikvenica. On the opposite site, social functioning of subjects from Kostrena was better in comparison to Crikvenica group. No signifficant differences between groups were found in physical functioning and in role limitation due to physical problems. In addition, there were no signifficant differences between groups in objective physical health parameters, such as pulmonary function, arterial blood pressure, pulse, and waist to hip ratio. Subjects using sensoric systems and the mental cognition about harmfull environmental factors, percieve their health worse if there are present industrial resources in their environment, even when concentration of the pollutants are within legal ranges.;"Air quality; Perception of health; Pulmonary and cardiovascular function; SF-36 questionnaire";"Adult; Air Pollution; Attitude to Health; Croatia; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Psychology, Industrial; Questionnaires; adult; air pollution; article; attitude to health; Croatia; female; health status; human; male; mental health; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; statistics";;1;0;0;1;0;1;Camille
