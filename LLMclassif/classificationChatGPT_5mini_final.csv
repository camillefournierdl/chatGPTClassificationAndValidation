- Perceptions: The survey examines how people in Beirut perceive air pollution (e.g., perceived air quality as ""very poor"", belief that it has deteriorated, seeing road traffic as a major source) and their general awareness/knowledge about the issue.

- Health: The study directly measures perceived health risks (50% perceive risks to themselves, 85% to the population) and reports which diseases respondents associate with air pollution (respiratory disorders, allergies, cancers).

- Behaviors: The survey reports on self-reported actions (or lack thereof), noting respondents did not report trying to decrease pollution levels or changing behavior to prevent/avoid exposure.

- Policy: Respondents’ awareness of, and trust in, environmental policies/decision makers is assessed (they were not aware of existing policies and did not trust decision makers/experts), which relates to attitudes toward institutional responses.

- Priority: The paper shows air pollution was rated the most serious environmental risk by respondents (even during a solid waste crisis), indicating perceived priority relative to other issues.
