As a solution, face masks have been used to protect against infection. Wearing face masks during indoor exercises is essential to prevent the spread of virus-containing respiratory droplets and aerosols. However, previous studies have not investigated all elements, including the users’ perceived breathability (PB) and perceived air quality (PAQ) when wearing a face mask during indoor exercises. The current study aimed to assess users’ perceived comfort (PC) of face masks based on assessment criteria of PB and PAQ during moderate to vigorous exercises, and compare them with those during normal daily activities. Data on PC, PB, and PAQ were collected from an online questionnaire survey from 104 participants doing regular moderate to vigorous exercises. Within-subjects comparison with self-controlled case series design was performed to compare PC, PB, and PAQ between wearing face masks during exercises and daily activities. Results showed that the degree of dissatisfaction with PC, PB, and PAQ while wearing face masks and performing indoor exercises is higher than when performing daily activities (p < 0.05). The significance of the study implies that masks comfortable for daily activities may not remain the same during moderate to vigorous exercises, especially during indoor exercises. © 2023 by the author.","airborne transmission; COVID-19 pandemic; face mask; indoor exercises; perceived air quality; perceived breathability; perceived comfort; self-controlled case series","Air Pollution; COVID-19; Humans; Masks; Respiratory Aerosols and Droplets; SARS-CoV-2; air quality; comparative study; COVID-19; disease transmission; physical activity; questionnaire survey; adult; air quality; Article; badminton; basketball; bowling; breathing; case study; comfort; controlled study; cycling; daily life activity; exercise; exercise intensity; female; human; male; questionnaire; satisfaction; treadmill exercise; yoga; air pollution; mask","","Scopus"

More specifically, the article surveys three families of image restoration methods serving the purpose of vision augmentation under adverse weather conditions. These image restoration methods are: (a) deraining; (b) desnowing; (c) dehazing ones. The contribution of this article is a survey of the recent literature on these three problem families, focusing on the utilization of deep learning (DL) models and meeting the requirements of their application in rescue operations. A faceted taxonomy is introduced in past and recent literature including various DL architectures, loss functions and datasets. Although there are multiple surveys on recovering images degraded by natural phenomena, the literature lacks a comprehensive survey focused explicitly on assisting FRs. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting existing methods in the literature, assessing their suitability for FR applications, and providing insights for future research directions.","deraining; dehazing; desnowing; deep learning; deep neural networks","Awareness; Deep Learning; Disasters; Rain; Snow; Demulsification; Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Restoration; Surveys; rain; snow; Adverse weather; Condition; Deep learning; Dehazing; Deraining; Desnowing; First responders; Rescue operations; Restoration methods; Situational awareness; awareness; disaster; Deep neural networks","NETWORK; REMOVAL; MODEL; COLOR; VISIBILITY; FRAMEWORK; DATASETS","WOS"

A large number of ambient air pollutants have been isolated from the fetal cord blood indicating that babies are exposed to air pollutants even before they are born. Children and the elderly are most susceptible to the harmful effects of ambient air pollutants. High levels of ambient air pollutants are associated with increased incidence or worsening of asthma and increased risk of developing allergic diseases, respiratory symptoms and respiratory tract infections. Mortality rates also increase in individuals with pre-existing cardiorespiratory diseases. The underlying mechanism for the harmful effects is the generation of oxidative stress which induces a strong respiratory as well as systemic inflammatory response. Individuals with genetic defects in enzymes associated with antioxidant defences seem to be particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of air pollutants. Supplementation with antioxidants such as N-acetyl cysteine and sulforaphene has shown some protective effects in preliminary studies. High doses of vitamin C and vitamin E have shown some benefit in genetically susceptible asthmatic children. Physicians should play an important role in advocating to governments for a reduction in ambient air pollutants using innovative strategies and stricter legislation. Clearly more research is required to better understand intervention strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality due to ambient air pollutants, but in the meantime, the least we can do is to supplement diets with rich sources of antioxidants.","","","","WOS"

In order to investigate the chemical characteristics of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) after the “coal substitution” policy, the PM2.5 samples were collected in the winter of Handan during four pollution periods from 2018 to 2020 and one pollution period in the counties of Wei and Jize in 2020 to analyze the water-soluble ions and carbonaceous aerosols. In Handan, the PM2.5 concentration in the winter decreased by 40.8% in 2020, compared with the initial stage of the implementation of the “coal substitution” policy in 2015. It indicated that the implementation of the “coal substitution” policy effectively improved the air quality. During the four pollution periods, the PM2.5 was alkaline with the average mass concentrations were (153.9±97.7), (164.5±78.7), (137.3±72.9) and (161.8± 84.3) μg/ m3, respectively. The average mass concentration of PM2.5 in Wei and Jize were (123.5±47.3) and (124.5± 53.4) μg/ m3, respectively. The analysis of water-soluble ions showed that the content of SNA (NH+4, NO-3, and SO24-) was the highest, accounting for 85.3% -90.0% of the total concentration of water-soluble ions. Compared with that in the winter of 2016 in Handan, the concentration of Cl-, as a tracer of coal combustion, decreased by 48.0% after the “coal substitution” policy, explaining the good results of the “coal substitution” policy. The ratio of NO-3 to SO24- mass concentration showed that the contribution of mobile sources (vehicle exhaust) was higher than that of stationary sources (coal combustion). The carbon aerosol analysis showed that the proportion of total carbon (TC) in PM2.5 decreased by 55.2%. In all survey regions, the organic carbon (OC) to elemental carbon (EC) ratio was greater than 2, demonstrating the existence of secondary organic carbon (SOC) pollution. The results of correlation analysis and principal component analysis showed that the main sources of carbon aerosols in Handan gradually changed from coal combustion and vehicle exhaust to biomass combustion during the implementation of the “coal substitution” policy. According to the potential source analysis, the main potential source areas of Handan, Wei, and Jize were central Shanxi, northwest Shandong, and north Henan. © 2022 China Coal Society.

However, the associations between anxiety behavior and toxicity caused by PM10 have rarely been reported so far. To investigate the changes of behavior after PM10 exposure and to identify the potential mechanisms of toxicity, PM10 samples (with doses of 15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) were intratracheally instilled into rats to simulate inhalation of polluted air by the lungs. After instillation for eight weeks, anxiety-like behavior was evaluated, levels of oxidative stress and morphological changes of hippocampus were measured. The behavioral results indicated that PM10 exposure induced obvious anxiety-like behavior in the open field and elevated plus maze tests. Both PM10 concentrations tested could increase whole blood viscosity and trigger hippocampal neuronal damage and oxidative stress by increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and malondialdehyde levels, and decreasing the expressions of antioxidant-related proteins (e.g., nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), SOD1 and heme oxygenase 1). Furthermore, through collecting and analyzing questionnaires, the data showed that the participants experienced obvious anxiety-related emotions and negative somatic responses under heavily polluted environments, especially PM10 being the main pollutant. These results show that PM10 exposure induces anxiety-like behavior, which may be related to suppressing the Nrf2/Keap1-SOD1 pathway.","Anxiety-like behavior; Oxidative stress; Nrf2; Hippocampus","Animals; Anxiety; Hippocampus; Humans; Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Oxidative Stress; Rats; Superoxide Dismutase-1; heme oxygenase 1; malonaldehyde; superoxide dismutase; transcription factor Nrf2; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; kelch like ECH associated protein 1; transcription factor Nrf2; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anxiety disorder; anxiety like behavior; Article; blood viscosity; controlled study; elevated plus maze test; hippocampus; human; long term exposure; male; morphology; nerve cell lesion; nonhuman; oxidative stress; PM10 exposure; protein expression; rat; toxicity; animal; anxiety; genetics; hippocampus; metabolism","AIRBORNE PARTICULATE MATTER; AIR-POLLUTION; SIGNALING PATHWAY; IMMUNE-RESPONSE; PM2.5; HEALTH; NEUROINFLAMMATION; EXPRESSION; DEPRESSION; MORTALITY","WOS"

This study investigates how people acquire information about the environment and EVs, and whether their opinions about environmental efficacy change over time and experience levels. These issues are explored across two data sets. The first data set is a panel survey of California households (n = 1718) and environmental opinions are tracked over two waves of survey. A decline in the environmental ethos is associated with several factors, including interpersonal communications and exposure to more specialized media. A sample of households from the panel study were subsequently chosen, among others, to participate in a 2-week long trial of EVs (n = 69). Opinions about environmental efficacy are studied as users gain first hand knowledge of an EV. Opinions about the environmental efficacy of the EV show improvement, but trial users become less likely to cite the environmental benefit as a reason for choosing the technology, and they do not change their opinions about providing policy incentives.

The results show that the corrosion rate of Q345qDNH is always less than that of Q420qENH, the Cr content of rust layer is higher than that of Q420qENH steel. After 30 days of corrosion, compared with Q420qENH steel, the self-corrosion potential of Q345qDNH is larger, the self-corrosion current density is smaller, and the rust resistance is 1.49 times of Q420qENH steel, the I alpha-FeOOH/I gamma-FeOOH ratio is 1.29 times of Q420qENH, indicating that the protection of the rust layer of Q345qDNH is better than that of Q420qENH. This is due to the effect of microstructure factors in the early stage of corrosion and alloying elements in the late stage of corrosion. PM2.5 with SiO2 as the main component is easy to deposit at cracks and holes, which becomes the nucleation substrate for corrosion products, promotes the nonuniform nucleation of corrosion products, making the rust layer develop unevenly, leading to an increase in holes in the outer rust layer.","alternating wet and dry corrosion; bridge weathering steel; industrial atmospheric environment; PM2.5","","CARBON-STEEL; WEATHERING STEEL; PARTICLES","WOS"

There is a lack of understanding the interrelationships of different physio-socio-psychological factors and the manifestation of their contextual interactions into cross-modal comfort perception. In that direction, this study used data from a post occupancy evaluation survey (n = 26), two longitudinal comfort studies (n = 1079 and n = 52) and concurrent measurements of indoor environmental quality factors (one building) to assess the effect of thermal, acoustic and air quality perception interactions on comfort and satisfaction of occupants in three mixed-mode university office buildings. The study concluded that thermal sensation (TSV) is associated with both air quality (ASV) and noise perception (NSV). The crossed effect of the interaction of air quality and noise perception on thermal sensation was not evident. The key finding was the significant correlation of operative temperature (T-op) with TSV as expected, but also with noise perception and overall acoustic comfort. Regarding the crossed main effects on thermal sensation, a significant effect was found for the interactions of (1) T-op and (2) sound pressure levels (SPL30) with air quality perception respectively. Most importantly, this study has highlighted the importance of air quality perception in achieving occupants' comfort and satisfaction with office space.","human thermal perception; comfort; multi-domain interactions; indoor air quality; noise sensation; cross-modal perception","Air quality; Office buildings; Thermal comfort; Comfort perception; Indoor environmental quality; Operative temperature; Post occupancy evaluation; Psychological factors; Quality perceptions; Sound pressure level; Thermal sensations; Acoustic noise","USER SATISFACTION; ENERGY USE; ENVIRONMENT; HEALTH; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN","WOS"

Interventions to avoid PM exposure are important but evidence-based guidance is lacking. This study aims to assess the impact of PM on lung function, quality of life and exacerbations in patients with COPD using a panel design study; it will also provide evidence for interventional measures to reduce harm from PM exposure. Methods and analysis A prospective panel study of patients with COPD aged >= 40 years will be conducted. Patients will be required to have a forced expiratory volume in one second <80% of the predicted value at enrolment. A total of 120 patients from three different regions will be enrolled, 60 from the metropolitan area, 30 from an industrialised area and 30 from a clean rural area. Clinical outcomes will be assessed through COPD assessment test scores, the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for patients with COPD and pulmonary function testing. Indoor and outdoor PM in the patients' environments will be measured using gravimetric and light scattering platforms. To estimate the individual dose of PM exposure, a time-activity diary, Geographic Information System and land use regression model will be combined in every season for 1 year. The correlation between PM exposure and the health status of patients with COPD will be evaluated. In addition, 40 patients with the lowest score of life behaviour score to reduce environmental PM exposure will be randomised to a control or intervention group, who will receive in-depth education on risk-reducing behaviours. Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each site. The participants received comprehensive information and provided informed consent. The result of this study will be discussed in the form of conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications.","chronic airways disease; thoracic medicine; adult thoracic medicine","Adult; Humans; Particulate Matter; Prospective Studies; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Quality of Life; Risk Reduction Behavior; adult; Article; behavior modification; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical outcome; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease exacerbation; forced expiratory volume; geographic information system; geography; gravimetry; health status; human; intervention study; land use; light scattering; lung function; major clinical study; panel study; predictive value; prospective study; quality of life; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; risk reduction; rural area; adverse event; chronic obstructive lung disease; particulate matter; quality of life","OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; SHORT-TERM EXPOSURE; ACUTE EXACERBATION; HEART-DISEASE; MORTALITY; HOSPITALIZATIONS; ASSOCIATION; BURDEN; LUNG","WOS"

This study examined the effects of air pollutants (ozone (O-3), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) on the searching behaviour of insect parasitoids. A series of experiments comprising short-term, closed chamber fumigations of O-3, SO2, and NO2 (100 nl 1(-1)) of the braconid parasitoid (Asobara tabida) and aggregated distributions of its host larvae (Drosophila subobscura) was set up. Analysis of chamber results showed that the proportion of hosts parasitised and the searching efficiency of the parasitoids were both significantly reduced with O-3 fumigation, but not with NO2 or SO2 fumigations. O-3 fumigation reduced percentage parasitism by approximately 10%. Parasitoids were able to avoid patches with no hosts, both in filtered air controls and when exposed to pollutants. However in the O-3 and NO2 treatments they appeared less able to discriminate between different host densities, suggesting that pollutants may interfere with the olfactory responses of the parasitoids. These results indicate the potential for air pollutants, particularly O-3, to negatively influence the searching behaviour of parasitoids, and hence reduce the efficiency of natural enemy control of many pest species.","insects; parasitoid; ozone; nitrogen dioxide; sulphur dioxide; searching behaviour; natural enemy control; Asobara tabida; Drosophila subobscura","","POPULATION; SO2","WOS"

Surveys conducted during this period have yielded lessons for designing better intervention strategies for the residential sector, taking into account the systematic morphological and economic limitations of the buildings concerned. These considerations should inform the development of policies and strategies for improving environmental quality compatible with lower residential energy consumption and higher quality of life. This study explores the effect of occupant behaviour on home ventilation and the perception of the impact of indoor air quality on user health before and during lockdown. The method deployed consisted in monitoring environmental variables and conducting user surveys before and after restrictions came into force. The findings showed that prior to lockdown, occupants were unaware of or paid little heed to changes in indoor air quality, failed to perceive stuffiness, and, as a rule, reported symptoms or discomfort only at night during the summer months. During lockdown, however, users came to attach greater importance to air quality, and a greater sensitivity to odours and a heightened awareness of CO2 concentration prompted them to ventilate their homes more frequently. In the spring of 2020, occupants also indicated a wider spectrum of indisposition, in particular in connection with sleep patterns.","Airtightness; Indoor air quality; Occupants' perception; Low-income housing; Ventilation behaviour; Health effects; COVID-19; Lockdown","air quality; COVID-19; environmental quality; housing; indoor air; residential energy; sleep; summer; ventilation","AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION; THERMAL COMFORT; CARBON-DIOXIDE; SLEEP QUALITY; AIRTIGHTNESS; PRODUCTIVITY; ENVIRONMENT; POLLUTION; IMPACTS; COOKING","WOS"

The research model is based on task-technology fit (TTF) and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) concepts. A comprehensive BDA-EAP management system is proposed and the potential adoption speed of such a system evaluated by sending structured questionnaires to the employees of relevant environmental agencies, yielding 412 valid responses, using the structural equation modeling approach. The results of the study predict that factors of TTF including task characteristics and technology characteristics are strong influencers of TTF, and TTF is a strong predictor of the behavioral intention of users to adopt a BDA-EAP management system. The results demonstrated that the combination of TTF and UTAUT is a stronger predictor of behavioral intention than either TTF or UTAUT alone. Furthermore, resistance to change negatively moderates and extrinsic motivation positively moderates the significant positive relationship between behavioral intention and adoption of a BDA-EAP management system.

It is unlikely that a complete set of those data exist for a specific study. Therefore, there will be a need to fill the necessary data gaps. As a first step towards this direction, the statistical behavior of the parameters involved can be estimated so that such parameters can be statistically reconstructed in finer scales. In this study the methodology has been applied to the air concentrations of the priority pollutants NO2, O-3, PM10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of < 10 mu m) and PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of < 2.5 mu m). More specifically, the hourly and the daily concentrations at a given site of those pollutants can be statistically reconstructed assuming known (a) the concentration annual average (m), (b) the pdf of the ratio of the standard deviation over the annual average (sigma/m) for the hourly/daily concentrations and (c) the pdf for hourly/daily concentrations themselves. In the case that PM2.5 annual value is missing, it is estimated statistically from the PM10 annual value and the PM2.5/PM10 ratio statistics. As a first test, the proposed methodology is applied for the year 2012 arriving to concrete proposals concerning the statistical behavior of the above-mentioned parameters.","Air concentrations; External exposure; Nitrogen dioxide; Ozone; Particulate matter","","IMPUTATION; EXPOSOME","WOS"

The present study attempts to clarify physicians’ moral responsibility in this regard and the roles they can play to decrease environmental problems. It also evaluates their attitudes towards and performance of these roles. The clarification of this issue paves the way for interventions through effective education or policy-making, as well as directing useful research. Materials and methods: A questionnaire was developed based on the results of qualitive study. The questionnaire assessed physicians’ awareness, attitude, and performance with regard to their environmental moral responsibilities. Results: Physicians with longer work experience had better performance. Those who worked in offices or at universities had also better performances compared to those working in hospitals. Physicians with more awareness had better performance, especially those who had acquired this awareness through books and educational workshops. The source of information was an effective factor on the gap between physicians’ attitude and performance scores those who had acquired information from books had the narrowest gap and those who had received information from social networks had the widest gap between attitude and performance scores. Conclusion: The health system and the environment and its problems are intertwined and greatly influence each other. Thus this interrelation and the necessity of being concerned and having moral sensitivity were explained. © 2021 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

Increasing attention from the news media, new health data, and public debate over the effectiveness of clean air regulations have raised the importance of air quality in the public consciousness. While public perceptions of air quality have been studied thoroughly dating back to the 1960s, little empirical research has been conducted to explain the spatial aspects of these perceptions, particularly at the local level. Although recent studies suggest characteristics of local setting are important in shaping perceptions of air quality, the roles of proximity, neighborhood characteristics, and location have not been clarified. This study seeks to improve understanding of the major factors shaping public perceptions of air quality by examining the spatial pattern of local risk perception, the role of socioeconomic characteristics in forming these perceptions, and the relationship between perceived and scientifically measured air pollution. First, we map the spatial pattern of local air quality perceptions using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) across the Dallas and Houston metropolitan areas. Next, we explain these perceptions through local contextual factors using both bivariate correlations and multivariate regression analysis. Results indicate that perceptions of air quality in the study areas are not significantly correlated with air quality based on readings of air monitoring stations. Instead, perceptions appear to be influenced by setting (urban vs. rural), state identification, access to information, and socioeconomic characteristics such as age, race, and political identification. We discuss the implications of the findings and provide direction on how further research can provide a deeper understanding of the local contextual factors influencing public perceptions.","Air quality; Environmental perceptions; Geographic Information Systems; Texas","Air Pollutants; Cities; Environment; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Ozone; Perception; Public Opinion; Regression Analysis; Research; Social Class; Statistics; Texas; North America; Texas; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Air pollution; Economic and social effects; Geographic information systems; Health; Information retrieval; Ozone; Statistical methods; Sulfur dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; metropolitan area; perception; spatial analysis; statistical analysis; air; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; air quality standard; article; data analysis; environmental health; environmental sanitation; geographic distribution; geographic information system; methodology; pollution monitoring; regression analysis; socioeconomics; spatial autocorrelation analysis; statistical analysis; United States; Bivariate correlations; News media; Public perceptions; State identification; Air quality","","Scopus"

Various investigations regarding particle reduction in urban green spaces have been conducted; however, specific guidelines to establish empirical data for green spaces and to inform related policies are still lacking. Thus, this study aims to categorize experts' perceptions of green spaces through Q-methodology and to identify ways to form a consensus, establish policies in the design and construction process, ultimately aiming to enhance particle reduction effects in urban green spaces. As a result, experts' perceptions were classified into three categories: 'active support,' 'skeptical,' and 'passive support' groups. Experts' opinions on the particle reduction effects of urban green areas are overarchingly agreed upon; however, the priorities involved and methods used in augmenting green space integration require further analysis and mediation. Additionally, further empirical evidence should be accumulated on the particulate matter reduction effects of urban green areas, including the quantification of particle concentration reduction in urban green spaces and considerations for policy establishment in design and construction. © 2019 by the authors.","Air pollution; Air pollution policy; Particulate matter; Q-method; Urban forest","air quality; atmospheric pollution; greenspace; numerical method; open space; particulate matter; perception; pollution policy; urban forestry; urban policy","","Scopus"

A review","Riley, R; de Preux, L; Capella, P; Mejia, C; Kajikawa, Y; de Nazelle, A",2021,"SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE","16","6","Solutions that engage the public are needed to tackle air pollution. Technological approaches are insufficient to bring urban air quality to recommended target levels, and miss out on opportunities to promote health more holistically through behavioural solutions, such as active travel. Behaviour change is not straightforward, however, and is more likely to be achieved when communication campaigns are based on established theory and evidence-based practices. We systematically reviewed the academic literature on air pollution communication campaigns aimed at influencing air pollution-related behaviour. Based on these findings, we developed an evidence-based framework for stimulating behaviour change through engagement. Across the 37 studies selected for analyses, we identified 28 different behaviours assessed using a variety of designs including natural and research-manipulated experiments, cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys and focus groups. While avoidance behaviour (e.g. reducing outdoor activity) followed by contributing behaviours (e.g. reducing idling) were by far the most commonly studied, supporting behaviour (e.g. civil engagement) shows promising results, with the added benefit that supporting local and national policies may eventually lead to the removal of social and physical barriers that prevent wider behavioural changes. Providing a range of actionable information will reduce disengagement due to feelings of powerlessness. Targeted localized information will appear more immediate and engaging, and positive framing will prevent cognitive dissonance whereby people rationalize their behaviour to avoid living with feelings of unease. Communicating the co-benefits of action may persuade individuals with different drivers but as an effective solution, it remains to be explored. Generally, finding ways to connect with people's emotions, including activating social norms and identities and creating a sense of collective responsibility, provide promising yet under-explored directions. Smartphones provide unique opportunities that enable flexible and targeted engagement, but care must be taken to avoid transferring responsibility for action from national and local authorities onto individuals. Multidisciplinary teams involving artists, members of the public, community and pressure groups, policy makers, researchers, and businesses, are needed to co-create the stories and tools that can lead to effective action to tackle air pollution through behavioural solutions.","Air quality; Communication; Engagement; Campaign; Information role","","HEALTH BELIEF MODEL; METROPOLITAN-AREA; QUALITY WARNINGS; SOCIAL NORMS; INFORMATION; ALERTS; IMPACT; CONSERVATION; SCIENCE; OZONE","WOS"

As a reference system without individual control, diffuse ceiling ventilation combined with a radiant panel system (DCV-RP) was also studied. In laboratory conditions, 10 males and 10 females gave subjective response to the indoor climate during various office activities. The indoor parameters and CO2 concentrations were measured. The results show that with the reference DCV-RP system, the indoor conditions were worse than with the LVRP and PVRP systems. The thermal sensation and perceived air quality with the PVRP system was better than the LVRP system. After a medium activity task, the thermal acceptability reverts faster with the PVRP than LVRP system. Both the LVRP and PVRP systems were able to create a micro-environment around the workstations and the CO2 concentrations near the workstation were slightly lower than at the exhaust grille. Compared with the PVRP system, the subjects preferred the higher airflow rate at the workstation with the LVRP system. Males preferred a higher airflow rate than females under the same conditions with both micro-environment systems. This research found that there was significant variation in the control preferences of the human subjects concerning the micro-environment, and this emphasizes the need for personalized control to ensure that all occupants are satisfied with the indoor conditions.","Human response; Personalized control; Micro-environment; Perceived air quality; Thermal sensation; CO2 concentration","","PRODUCTIVITY LOSS; COMFORT; SENSATION; PERFORMANCE; TEMPERATURE; MOVEMENT; HEALTH; WORK; WARM","WOS"

While scientific interest in the problem continues to grow, efforts to measure indoor pollution concentrations, define exposure levels, and estimate health risks remain in their infancy. Within this arena, policymakers must deal with the question of how best to protect public health and safety in the face of incomplete and often contradictory information. In the past, official response to environmental pollution has traditionally taken the form of ""control by regulation."" However, creation of a regulatory framework for indoor air quality poses special policy issues that suggest the need to explore alternative modes of intervention. Ambient outdoor air is a public good, in the sense that enjoyment by one individual in no way detracts from use or enjoyment by others. Indoor air, on the other hand, is not a public good, especially in private residences. Costs and benefits of maintaining adequate indoor air quality are internalized within households, suggesting the possibility of a private demand for clean indoor air. Promulgation of indoor air quality standards and other regulations must confront the fact that individuals are already making decisions about their own air quality. Regulations might or might not improve these decisions. Development of effective and reasonable policy requires an appreciation of the scope for private action and consideration of the likelihood that public intervention will foster improved private choices. Among the logical and relatively inexpensive modes of intervention are public information programs, development of simple warning devices, and product testing and labeling. © 1982.","","BUILDINGS; ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING - Public Policy; ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION; air quality control; housing; human; indoor air pollution; prevention; public opinion; therapy; REGULATIONS; AIR POLLUTION","","Scopus"

A systemic review of existing literature was performed, including identification, screening, and scoping phases. This was followed by a keyword-based scientometric analysis. By further refining keywords, this tri-dimensional relationship was highlighted through cross-disciplinary knowledge interactions using a content analysis method. A network analysis map helped identify critical criteria and sub-criteria, later categorized into four clusters of governing data variables. A survey-based Relative Importance Weight (RIW) benchmark was performed for each variable, exhibiting its contribution towards attaining an efficient IAQ-SBR process.

Meanwhile, the ambient air pollution via particulate matter in such areas is closely related to the physical and mental health of the elderly visitors who suffer long-term exposure. This study is initiated to build a technological path between haze exposure and the elderly based on the positive and negative relationship between greenspace exposure and haze exposure under the background of the national strategy of healthy aging. In addition, the structured questionnaire interviews and the measured evidence-based experiments were conducted to collect data including physical environment data, crowd activity data, haze cognition data and basic population information. Combined with various statistical analyses including correlation analysis and mediating factor analysis, the impacts of haze in urban greenspaces on the decisions of the elderly to go out to visit such spaces as well as their physical and mental health were explored. A total of 138 crowd activity data and climate data were recorded, and 200 valid questionnaires were obtained. The results showed that the physical exercise and the social contact were two main reasons for the elderly to the greenspaces, and the typical activities of the elderly varied with the difference of physical environment using correlation and mediating effect analysis. Moreover, the air quality of six research sites reached or even be above moderate pollution (PM2.5 ≥115μg/ m3) during more than 70% of the survey period, suggesting that the air quality was worrying and exposed elderly visitors to serious health risks. According to questionnaire, the cognitive limitations on the potential hazards of haze were commonly existed in the elderly due to insufficient understanding of haze, vague perception and psychological neglect. In addition, the multiple and complex internal driving forces led to the decision-making of the elderly people to go to the greenspaces more perceptual than rational. Overall, there is no prominent correlation between PM2.5 concentration and crowd activities, showing that haze has little impact on the travel decision of the elderly since their insensitivity to haze pollution. There exists a gap between the cognitive decision of the elderly and the actual potential health hazards of haze. The results highlight the urgency of measures to promote healthy aging, and the importance of actively promoting the optimization of elderly-oriented landscape, which has certain reference value for the current human settlement environment construction. © 2022 Science Press.

To find answers to these questions, we applied quantitative methods for data collection and analysis. The first stage involved collecting data on subjective correlation of a verbal probability scale with its numeric expression among people living in industrial cities. The second stage focused on testing the methodology for studying assessments of health risks associated with ambient air pollution given by the population/social groups. This methodology relied on the results obtained at the previous stage. We established that only 70 % of people actually correlated words with figures. We determined that experts tended to rate probabilities approximately by 10 % higher than “average people” did when it came down to such words as “Virtually certain” and “Very likely”. Such words as “Likely”, “Similarly likely” and “Unlikely” were also rated differently but with a smaller gap between the opinions. The study also provides a method for determining the public assessment of health risks associated with ambient air pollution.

Indoor air questionnaires are useful for collecting information about the occupants' experiences and perceptions of the indoor air and for evaluating the results of the measures taken. A common way to implement health questionnaires is to ask the respondents to describe symptoms at certain time points, such as weeks or months. The aim of our study was to develop a short and easy online questionnaire to assess symptoms and perceived IAQ. We also aimed to test the usability of the questionnaire in school buildings and assess the differences between the online measurement data (CO2, T, and RH) and the IAQ complaints and symptoms reported by the pupils. A total of 105 teachers and 1268 pupils in 36 classrooms at six schools answered the questionnaires over a two-week period. The participants completed the questionnaire always after the lesson in the studied classroom. We received 719 answers from the teachers and 6322 answers from the pupils. The results demonstrated that the teachers reported more IAQ problems and symptoms than the pupils did. Differences between classrooms were observed in both the IAQ problem and reference schools. The most common significant differences (p-value > 0.05) between the classrooms were among humidity, too cold air, and stuffy air, and among symptoms, dry/sore throat, tiredness, headache, and skin symptoms. Maximum values of CO2 measurements and the highest prevalence of stuffy air were relatively consistent. The testing process demonstrated that such a questionnaire was suitable for adults and children aged at least 12 years. The results of our study suggest that a quick and easy online questionnaire that is completed within a short period may be useful for gathering valuable knowledge about perceived IAQ. It could be used in combination with other indoor environment investigations to produce detailed results and restorative measures.","indoor air; health questionnaire; symptoms; pupils; teachers","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Health; Indoor air pollution; Teaching; Indoor air; Indoor air quality; Indoor environment; On-line measurement data; Online questionnaire; Pupils; Symptoms; Teachers; air quality; health survey; indoor air; questionnaire survey; student; symptom; Surveys","RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; ELEMENTARY-SCHOOLS; HEALTH SYMPTOMS; VENTILATION RATES; MOISTURE DAMAGE; CHILDREN; ASTHMA; DAMPNESS; ASSOCIATIONS; PERFORMANCE","WOS"

Addressing IAQ not only means ensuring that contaminants are below harmful concentration but also that people exposed are satisfied. However, current standards often lack clear metrics and thresholds dedicated to Perceived Air Quality (PAQ). Therefore, it is important to examine whether there is a prevalent method in the literature that could lead towards standardization. This review study constitutes the first comprehensive critical exploration of the subject. Adopting the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses) guidelines, the objective is to synthesize and compare diverse methods (subjective vs instrumental evaluations; object of judgment; component of perception; rating scales) for assessing PAQ in office buildings, based on insights from 93 field and laboratory studies. Results show that the assessment of PAQ predominantly relies on questionnaires (90 %), with a very smaller percentage using alternative methods such as olfactory indices, diaries, interviews, sensory testing, and text mining techniques. Workers' satisfaction is the most commonly evaluated aspect in PAQ questionnaires, often measured on a 7-point Likert scale. Odours are typically characterized in terms of intensity by utilizing a continuous 6-point unidirectional scale. Olfactory stimuli are usually considered with a negative connotation, being the absence of odour the target of IAQ design. The present study proposes a future research agenda that introduces the importance of a perceptual approach to evaluate the indoor olfactory environments (or smellscapes), aiming to create working spaces that are not only odour-neutral but also olfactorily pleasant.","Indoor environmental quality; Odour; Office buildings; Perceived air quality; Smellscape","Air quality; Indoor air pollution; Odors; 'current; Air quality assessment; Diverse methods; Indoor air quality; Indoor environmental quality; Meta-analysis; Perceived air quality; Smellscape; Systematic Review; Well being; air quality; building; environmental assessment; environmental quality; indoor air; literature review; odor; Office buildings","LEED-CERTIFIED BUILDINGS; ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY; OCCUPANT SATISFACTION; SBS SYMPTOMS; DISPLACEMENT VENTILATION; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; USER SATISFACTION; WORK PERFORMANCE; COMFORT; IMPACT","WOS"

Interdisciplinary research of the indoor environment (technical and medical fields) was based on the simultaneous measurement of the thermal environment parameters, as well on as on surveying employees during their normal working activities. The survey sought to determine the health status and health problems of those surveyed in the 6 months prior to the study, as well as the current state of health and current subjective evaluation of the thermal environment and air quality. Deviations between the measured values evaluated by predicted mean vote (PMV) - predicted percent of dissatisfied (PPD) model (PMV-PDD) and the subjective evaluations of thermal environment of those surveyed were found. The subjectively stated reasons for the health problems of employees gave precedence to natural, as opposed to mechanical, ventilation, which is confirmed by the average absence from work for health reasons. An index of health was defined and analyzed for the people within a building. Significant correlations between indoor air parameters and the way people felt were found. Findings from the study indicate a significant role for the psychological factors and psychological state of the respondents when subjectively describing the indoor environment.","thermal environment; perceived air quality; health index; symptom prevalence; well-being; air conditioning; natural ventilation","carbon dioxide; volatile organic compound; absenteeism; adult; air conditioning; air quality; ambient air; article; building; environmental temperature; female; health status; health survey; human; humidity; male; occupational health; prediction; priority journal; psychological aspect","SICK-BUILDING-SYNDROME; SYNDROME SBS; COMFORT; WORKERS","WOS"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate possible associations between ventilation system type and occupant perception of indoor air quality. Staff (n = 403) from 12 schools completed a self-administered questionnaire. Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, air exchange rates, and particle counts were also measured for each school. Schools with unit ventilator (UV) systems had the lowest mean CO2 level at 637 ppm, followed by the variable air volume (VAV) systems with 664 ppm, and constant volume (CV) systems with a mean of 703 ppm. Schools with UV systems had the lowest mean air exchange rate at 2.67 air changes per hour (ACH), followed by the VAV system type at 2.80 ACH and the CV system type at 4.61 ACH. Indoor versus outdoor particle ratios were calculated for each ventilation system type. Particles with aerodynamic diameters ranging from 0.1-1.0 μm had a geometric mean ratio ranging from 0.38 to 0.68; particles with aerodynamic diameters ranging from 1-3 μm had ratios ranging from 1.39 to 5.47, and particles with aerodynamic diameters greater than 3 μm had ratios ranging from 3.20 to 14.76. Schools using VAV systems had a significantly lower prevalence of red and watery eyes while schools with UV systems had an elevated prevalence of nasal congestion, sore throat, headache, and dustiness complaints. This increased prevalence of complaints in buildings with UV systems may be due to the increased particulate levels. © 2001 Applied Industrial Hygiene.","Air Exchange Rates; Indoor Air Quality; Particle Counts; Questionnaire; Schools; Ventilation System Types","Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; Colorado; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Male; Perception; Questionnaires; Schools; Ventilation; carbon dioxide; air conditioning; air pollutant; air quality; ambient air; article; atmospheric dispersion; carbon dioxide measurement; dust; eye irritation; geometry; headache; nose congestion; perception; prevalence; primary school; priority journal; sore throat; suspended particulate matter; ventilator","","Scopus"

Over the past four decades it has released large amounts of volcanic gases and aerosols which form vol-canic air pollution known as 'vog'. Communities downwind of Kilauea have been chronically or episodically exposed to this potentially harmful air pollution and have raised concerns about the hazards of vog exposure. Public health and civil protection agencies have offered a range of ad -vice, information, and mitigation strategies for living with vog. In this mixed-methods social study, we investigate the translation of official advice into practice in Island of Hawai'i communi-ties and assess how risk communication could be improved by considering public input, prefer-ences, and community relevance. Given the paucity of information on the long-term effects of chronic vog exposure, assessing the effectiveness of public health and risk communication is vi-tal. In 2015, through questionnaire surveys (n = 143), four focus groups and several stakeholder meetings, we assessed whether, and how, residents accessed intervention advice, if it was rele-vant and useful, how they acted on it and how they would like to receive advice and urgent expo-sure warnings in the future. We also investigated local knowledge and self-developed interven-tions and documented the perceived risks of vog exposure, including symptoms that people at-tribute to vog. Most participants (83%) perceived that vog caused health symptoms such as exacerbation of asthma, itchy eyes, and blocked nose and 62% thought it was harmful to their long-term health. A third of participants had considered relocating to avoid the vog yet, despite this, most people took no action to reduce vog exposure. Participants reported that the official advice was difficult to follow given their living situation or lifestyle. Some participants viewed the agency advice as in -consistent, irrelevant, or out of date. Participants preferred to receive advice and air quality alerts via a variety of media, depending on factors such as their access to internet, cell phone, and radio reception. The study findings led to a collaboration with federal and state health, land management, ed-ucational, science, and civil protection agencies to improve and standardize health advisory mes-saging, to make it more relevant to Island of Hawai'i communities and environment. New print- able and web-based communication products were developed, which included local knowledge of effective protective actions/symptom reduction strategies. An interagency 'Vog Dashboard' was also introduced to consolidate vog knowledge, including sources of air quality data, vog fore-casts, and advice on vog environmental, agricultural, and health impacts. This dashboard was recommended as a primary site for advice by international media outlets in 2018 and was heavily used during the 2018 Kilauea and 2022 Mauna Loa eruption crises.","Hawaii; Volcano; Risk communication; Air pollution; Vog; Perceptions; Exposure mitigation","","KILAUEA VOLCANO; HEALTH; DISPERSION; CRISIS; TRUST; VOG","WOS"

Aims: Examine associations of gestational and childhood exposure to traffic-related pollution with executive function and behavior problems in children. Methods: We studied associations of pre- and postnatal pollution exposures with neurobehavioral outcomes in 1212 children in the Project Viva pre-birth cohort followed to mid-childhood (median age 7.7 years). Parents and classroom teachers completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Using validated spatiotemporal models, we estimated exposure to black carbon (BC) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the third trimester of pregnancy, from birth to 3 years, from birth to 6 years, and in the year before behavioral ratings. We also measured residential distance to major roadways and near-residence traffic density at birth and-in mid-childhood. We estimated associations of BC, PM2.5, and other traffic exposure measures with BRIEF and SDQ scores, adjusted for potential confounders. Results: Higher childhood BC exposure was associated with higher teacher-rated BRIEF Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) scores, indicating greater problems: 1.0 points (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.0, 2.1) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in birth-age 6 BC, and 1.7 points (95% CI: 0.6, 2.8) for BC in the year prior to behavioral ratings. Mid childhood residential traffic density was also associated with BRI score (0.6, 95% CI: 0.1,1.1). Birth-age 3 BC was not associated with BRIEF or SDQscores. Third trimester BC exposure was not associated with teacher-rated BRI scores ( -0.2, 95% CI: -1.1, 0.8), and predicted lower scores (fewer problems) on the BRIEF Metacognition Index (-1.2, 95% CI: -2.2, -0.2) and SDQ total difficulties (-0.9, 95% CI: -1.4, -0.4). PM2.5 exposure was associated with teacher-rated BRIEF and SDQscores in minimally adjusted models but associations attenuated with covariate adjustment. None of the parent-rated outcomes suggested adverse effects of greater pollution exposure at any time point. Conclusions: Children with higher mid-childhood exposure to BC and greater near-residence traffic density in mid childhood had greater problems with behavioral regulation as assessed by classroom teachers, but not as assessed by parents. Prenatal and early childhood exposure to traffic-related pollution did not predict greater executive function or behavior problems; third trimester BC was associated with lower scores (representing fewer problems) on measures of metacognition and behavioral problems.

However, exposure-response models for this relationship have not been developed. One of the main challenges is to identify a compound that can be used as proxy for livestock odor exposure. In this paper we developed models that describe the relationship between long-term averaged outdoor residential ammonia (NH3) exposures and livestock odor annoyance experienced by rural residents, and investigated person-related variables associated with annoyance responses. We used emission-based atmospheric dispersion modeling data to estimate household-specific outdoor concentrations and survey data to characterize the study subjects. Binomial and multinomial logistic regressions were used for model development. Residential NH3 exposure was positively associated with moderate, high and extreme odor annoyance (adjusted odds ratio = 10.59: 95% confidence interval: 1.35-83.13, for each unit increase in Log(e)NH(3) exposure). Specific characteristics of the exposed subjects (i.e., age, time per week spent at home, presence of children at home and job) act as co-determinants of odor annoyance responses. Predictive models showed classification accuracies of 67-72%. The results suggest that NH3 exposure in the residential outdoor environment can be used as a predictor of livestock odor annoyance in population studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, an example of haze network public opinion risk shows that the approach has good identification and assessment effect. The approach can be used to solve the problems of fuzziness and subjectivity in linguistic assessments, and it can be applied to identify the customer service framework with the linguistic assessments process in emergency management.

Clinicians cite their lack of education as a common barrier. We developed a two-minute animated video on mitigating air pollution health risks and evaluated the efficacy of this video as an educational tool.MethodsIn March-June 2021, a convenience sample of Minnesota interprofessional health learners and clinicians viewed the video and completed an electronic survey that assessed pre-/post-video intervention changes in (a) didactic and clinically applied knowledge on health impacts of air pollution, (b) perceived comfort in identifying at-risk patients and counseling them on relevant preventive health behaviors, (c) intentions/barriers to counseling patients, (d) beliefs and attitudes related to the health harms of air pollution, and (e) perceptions of the overall acceptability of the intervention.ResultsThe 218 participants included learners and clinicians in medicine, nursing, and advanced practice provision. Respondents' knowledge scores and self-reported level of comfort in identifying high-risk patients and counseling them on preventative health behaviors increased significantly pre-/post-intervention. The video also effectively altered participants' misperceptions about the health impacts of air pollution. While less than half of participants (43.6%) reported they intended to engage in counseling patients as a result of watching the video, 52.3% indicated they might do so. Lack of time during clinical encounters and lack of training were reported as persistent barriers to engaging in this counseling. Overall, participants found the video to be an effective educational tool, indicating that they wanted their colleagues and patients to watch the video and would like to see further short, animated videos on other environmental health topics.ConclusionsA two-minute animated educational video significantly improved knowledge of inequitable health impacts of air pollution and improved perceived comfort in identifying and counseling at-risk patients among health professional learners and clinicians regardless of profession, level of training, or pre-intervention knowledge level.

Some argue that smoking restrictions or bans would result in a business drop, assuming > 50% of patrons smoke. Evidence in Nevada and responses from the 2008 California tobacco survey refute this assertion. The present study investigates the proportion of active smokers in southern California tribal casinos, as well as occupancy and PM2.5 levels in smoking and nonsmoking sections. Methods: We measured active-smoker and total-patron counts during Friday or Saturday night visits (two per casino) to smoking and nonsmoking gaming areas inside 11 southern California casinos. We counted slot machines and table games in each section, deriving theoretical maximum capacities and occupancy rates. We also measured PM2.5 concentrations (or used published levels) in both nonsmoking and smoking areas. Results: Excluding one casino visit with extremely high occupancy, we counted 24,970 patrons during 21 casino visits of whom 1,737 were actively smoking, for an overall active- smoker proportion of 7.0% and a small range of similar to 5% across casino visits (minimum of 5% and maximum of 10%). The differences in mean inter-casino active-smoker proportions were not statistically significant. Derived occupancy rates were 24% to 215% in the main (low-stakes) smoking-allowed slot or table areas. No relationship was found between observed active-smoker proportions and occupancy rate. The derived maximum capacities of nonsmoking areas were 1% to 29% of the overall casino capacity (most under 10%) and their observed occupancies were 0.1 to over 3 times that of the main smoking-allowed casino areas. Seven of twelve visits to nonsmoking areas with no separation had occupancy rates greater than main smoking areas. Unenclosed nonsmoking areas don't substantially protect occupants from PM2.5 exposure. Nonsmoking areas encapsulated inside smoking areas or in a separate, but unenclosed, area had PM2.5 levels that were 10 to 60 mu g/m(3) and 6 to 23 mu g/m(3) higher than outdoor levels, respectively, indicating contamination from smoking. Conclusions: Although fewer than roughly 10% of casino patrons are actively smoking on average, these individuals substantially increase PM2.5 exposure for all patrons in smoking and unenclosed nonsmoking areas. Nonsmoking areas may be too inconvenient, small, or undesirable to serve a substantial number of nonsmoking patrons. Imposing indoor smoking bans, or contained smoking areas with a maximum capacity of up to 10% of the total patronage, would offer protection from PM2.5 exposures for nonsmoking patrons and reduce employee exposures.","Secondhand smoke; Fine particles; Active smoker counts; Nonsmoking gaming","Air Pollution, Indoor; California; Gambling; Humans; Particulate Matter; Smoking; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; MLCS; MLOWN; article; human; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; passive smoking; pathological gambling; smoking; United States","ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO-SMOKE; SECONDHAND SMOKE; AIR-POLLUTION; EXPOSURE","WOS"

It has recently been patented and presented a novel individual endonasal disposable medical device (temporarily named Smart Nose), consisting in a couple of small cone trunks with an internal helix (the entire tool in soft medical silicone), which ""captures"" and eliminates airborne particulate matter, in particular of polluting origin (PM) but also of allergic nature. Air clearance from such noxious particles has been assessed, as well as nasal resistances, with different configurations of the device, and consequently the most ""equilibrated"" geometry has been selected considering the best possible ""filtering"" efficiency vs the best possible respect of nasal respiratory patency. The ""capturing"" properties of the device are due to a special biogel stratified on the internal surface of each cone trunk and helix: such biogel captures PM due to its electrostatic properties, fixes it thank to its high viscosity and eliminates it (it's disposable). Aim. This paper presents the results of a survey on the opinion of a sample of citizens about the potential agreement on such individual defense from atmospheric pollutants and other airborne noxious particles. Subjects andmethod.The interwiewed persons were 279 common citizens transiently exposed to urban outdoor pollution, but also persons more ""sensible"" to pollution and airborne particle-derived problems: 19 citizens suffering from allergic oculorhinitis and bronchial asthma, 50 workers operating in an open urban context or unhealthy environment, plus 52 snorers not belonging to such last two categories. Results. The survey in general has demonstrated high interest of the interviewed persons towards Smart Nose: a positive impression has been referred by 70% common citizens, 84% allergics, 73% ""polluted"" workers. 46% snorers. About 50% of the potential users are convinced about the utility of the device by the description of its characteriscics, others would prefer to test it in advance. Neither invasivity nor fear of unpleasant nasal sensations are likely to constitute a problem: a proposed costless proof is accepted by >90% of the sample, specially by younger people. Conclusion. Exposure to the inhalation to noxious particulate matter is a sensible problem for the citizens, specially those exposed to PM for professional reasons or allergic to pollens and other airborne allergens; less for subjects suffering from disturbances whose solution is linked to proper curative measures more than to preventive ones (snorers). Hope in possible measures intended to clear inspired air passes also through the expectance of relatively costless individual solutions such as that represented by Smart Nose device.","Aero-allergens; Air pollution; Medical device; Opinion survey; Particulate matter","allergen; air pollution; air pollution control; allergic rhinitis; asthma; cost benefit analysis; device; disposable equipment; endonasal disposable device; health care survey; human; interview; nose airway resistance; occupational exposure; particulate matter; pollen allergy; review; snoring; urban area","","Scopus"

Therefore, people who suffer from respiratory diseases are more vulnerable to variations in air quality, as direct exposure leads to exacerbation of symptoms, more hospitalizations, and behavioral changes. This study aims to examine the impact of air pollution on the travel behavior of people with respiratory diseases. To accomplish this objective, a mixed methodological approach is used, applying questionnaires and interviews. The results show that visitors with respiratory diseases are more likely to value air quality and to engage in adaptive measures to prevent the effects of air pollution episodes at the destination. This study enriches the tourism literature by examining how air quality influences visitors with respiratory illnesses and provides practical implications for the tourism industry.","Tourism; Respiratory diseases; Air quality; Adaptive behaviors; Travel behavior","","PARTICULATE MATTER; INBOUND TOURISM; POLLUTION; IMPACT; CHINA; SMOG; SEGMENTATION; ASSOCIATION; RESPONSES; PORTUGAL","WOS"

The effects of adding these K salts on SO2-SO3 conversion and on denitration behavior over the catalyst were studied, using reactor trials and various characterization methods, including NH3-TPD, H-2-TPR, ICP, BET, XRD, SEM, FT-IR and XPS. The results of catalytic activity evaluation tests show that adding K salts decreases the denitration efficiency, while SO2 enhances the activity of the KCl-poisoned catalyst to an extent. The presence of K salts also improves the SO3 formation rate, such that the SO3 formation rate for the K2SO4-poisoned catalyst is as high as 1.53% at 410 degrees C (compared with 0.60% for the fresh catalyst). The characterization data indicate that K salts aggregate on the catalyst surface, blocking the pores of the catalyst. The reduction ability of the catalyst is decreased slightly and new weakly acidic sites appear. In addition, the concentration of strongly acidic sites declines. SO2 can increase the surface acidity of the catalyst. K salts increase the number of V5+=O bonds and weakly acidic sites, but consume oxygen atoms along with V and W species. Importantly, the strength of the V5+=O bonds, the concentration of surface chemically adsorbed oxygen and the V4+/V5+ ratio all played vital roles in improving the conversion of SO2-SO3 and in enhancing the NO reduction.

(2) Methods: We linked daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) measures with survey responses of participants in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). Generalized linear mixed modeling (GLMM) was used to estimate the relationship between CMD risk and social-demographic characteristics, behavioral and personal risk factors, and exposure levels of PM2.5. (3) Results: The study resulted in four key findings: (1) PM2.5 concentration level was significantly associated with reported CMD, with risk rising by 2.6% for each mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5; (2) race did not predict CMD risk when clinical, lifestyle, and environmental risk factors were accounted for; (3) a significant variation of CMD risk was found among participants across states; and (4) multiple personal, clinical, and social-demographic and environmental risk factors played a role in predicting CMD occurrence.

This scoping review aimed to identify previous research evaluating individuals' perceptions of air pollution and its health effects, and to explore the measurement of perceptions, as a key resource for health behaviour.MethodsThe review followed the methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. PubMed and Web of Science were searched. After initial and full-text screening, we further selected studies with standardised scales that had previously been tested for reliability and validity in assessing awareness and perceptions.ResultsAfter full-text screening, 95 studies were identified. 'Perception/awareness of air quality' was often measured, as well as 'Perception of health risk.' Only nine studies (9.5%) used validated scaled questionnaires. There was considerable variation in the scales used to measure the multiple dimensions of risk perception for air pollution.ConclusionFew studies used structured scales to quantify individuals' perceptions, limiting comparisons among studies. Standardised methods for measuring health risk perception are needed. Main findings: Among 95 studies assessing health risk perception of air pollution, only nine studies used standardised scales.Added knowledge: There was considerable variation in the scales measuring the multiple dimensions of risk perception for air pollution, which makes comparison among the studies difficult.Global health impact for policy and action: This review highlights the need for the development of globally standardised scale to measure the health risk perception of air pollution.","Air pollution; air quality; health risk; health risk perception; standardised scales; awareness","Air Pollution; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Perception; Risk Assessment; Surveys and Questionnaires; adverse event; air pollution; attitude to health; human; perception; procedures; questionnaire; risk assessment","QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PERCEIVED HEALTH; ENVIRONMENTAL RISK; PUBLIC PERCEPTION; URBAN; AWARENESS; KNOWLEDGE; EXPOSURE; EXPERIENCE; SMOG","WOS"

A total of 244 subjects (65 males and 179 females) responded to questionnaires in a design studio operated with DOAS-CF at a warmer setpoint temperature of 27 degrees C and a computer lab operated with FCU at a setpoint temperature of 24 degrees C (which is common for the Tropics). Occupants under DOAS-CF at 27 degrees C felt more thermally comfortable and expressed higher thermal acceptability than those under FCU at 24 degrees C through their behavioral adjustment in choosing their sitting location based on their thermal and air movement preferences. With DOAS-CF, the cooling experienced by the nose has favorably inclined the olfactory sense towards PAQ; however, there is a small percentage who felt the PAQ was unacceptable as they were also thermally uncomfortably warm. Energy consumption of DOAS-CF was 27.7% lower than that of FCU due to warmer setpoint temperature. Despite creating a wide range of effective temperatures, DOAS-CF system can achieve better thermal comfort when occupants' behavioral adaptation is empowered; it also achieves higher energy conservation by increasing setpoint temperature than the conventional mixing AC system.","Air movement; Thermal comfort and acceptability; Perceived air quality; Dedicated outdoor air system with ceiling fans; Behavioral adjustment; Field survey","Air conditioning; Air quality; College buildings; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Felt; Felts; Surveys; Thermal comfort; Air movement preferences; Behavioral adaptation; Conventional air-conditioning systems; Dedicated outdoor air systems; Effective temperature; Perceived air quality; Set-point temperatures; Thermal acceptabilities; air conditioning; air quality; airflow; field survey; perception; temperature effect; ventilation; Behavioral research","","WOS"

It explores nine crucial variables: Effort Expectancy (EE), Performance Expectancy (PE), Social Influence (SI), Facilitating Condition (FC), Hedonic Motivation (HM), Price Value (PV), Habit (HB), and TR using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) framework. Data collection involved 371 participants via surveys and questionnaires, with demographic variables such as Gender (G), Age (A), and Location (L) serving as moderating factors. Analysis conducted with smart-pls 4.0 software revealed a notable correlation between TR and BIU, identifying HM as the most pivotal factor. The study's theoretical and practical contributions offer a nuanced understanding of the integration between TR features and the UTAUT2 model, highlighting HM's critical role in influencing AQMS user behaviors. Furthermore, it delivers strategic insights for developers and policymakers aimed at improving air quality monitoring systems. The research enhances the comprehension of technology adoption dynamics in environmental surveillance, setting the groundwork for refining AQMS's deployment and efficacy. It aligns technological innovations with user inclinations, underscoring the combined effects of TR and HM on AQMS-related user actions. Ultimately, the findings illuminate TR's significance and interplay within the UTAUT2 framework, providing actionable recommendations for crafting more effective air quality monitoring solutions.","Air quality; behavioral intention to use (BIU); AQMS; technology readiness (TR); pollutant","Behavioral research; Economic and social effects; Environmental technology; Air quality monitoring; Air quality monitoring solution; Behavioral intention; Behavioral intention to use; Hedonic motivations; Intention to use; Pollutant; Technology readiness; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Air quality","ACCEPTANCE; ADOPTION; MODEL; MANAGEMENT; POLLUTION; COVID-19; BANKING","WOS"

Conservation targets are multiple, and increasingly incorporate services derived from nature as well as concepts of intrinsic value. Priorities vary. How then should changes in a set of species caused by drivers such as N deposition be assessed? We used a novel combination of qualitative semi-structured interviews and quantitative ranking to elucidate the views of conservation professionals specialising in grasslands, heathlands and mires. Although conservation management goals are varied, terrestrial habitat quality is mainly assessed by these specialists on the basis of plant species, since these are readily observed. The presence and abundance of plant species that are scarce, or have important functional roles, emerged as important criteria for judging overall habitat quality. However, species defined as 'positive indicator-species' (not particularly scarce, but distinctive for the habitat) were considered particularly important. Scarce species are by definition not always found, and the presence of functionally important species is not a sufficient indicator of site quality. Habitat quality as assessed by the key informants was rank-correlated with the number of positive indicator-species present at a site for seven of the nine habitat classes assessed. Other metrics such as species-richness or a metric of scarcity were inconsistently or not correlated with the specialists' assessments. We recommend that metrics of habitat quality used to assess N pollution impacts are based on the occurrence of, or habitat- suitability for, distinctive species. Metrics of this type are likely to be widely applicable for assessing habitat change in response to different drivers. The novel combined qualitative and quantitative approach taken to elucidate the priorities of conservation professionals could be usefully applied in other contexts. © 2016 Rowe et al.

This study aimed to explore how the residents perceived and reacted to the new threats of the epidemic and how KA may affect the correlation. Based on the health belief model (HBM), this research took the pharmacy service utilization (PSU) as an example to explain the preventive behavior. The samples were 375 respondents recruited from five districts near the industrial parks. T-test, ANOVA, and regression analyses of SPSS 22.0 were used to analyze the data. Test results show that self-efficacy was the strongest predictor, followed by the net perceived benefit. KA moderated the association of perceived threat and PSU intention. The levels of air pollution of a district may not be a good predictor for the preventive behavior against COVID-19. © 2022 by the authors.
