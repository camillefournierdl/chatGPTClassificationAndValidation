Currently, 94% of the world population face air pollution levels considered unsafe by the World Health Organization, which tells us that efforts are needed to raise people's awareness about air pollution. The use of serious games and gamification of interactive applications have raised people's perception. This work presents Problems in the Air, a game developed in Unity about air pollution, in which the player's goal is to control a character that inhabits an imaginary city tasked to monitor indoor and outdoor air pollution with sensors deployed across several city zones. While playing, children are expected to learn the possible causes of pollution in each zone and, this way, the game attempts to promote pro-environmental behaviors. This game allows educators to configure the problems that the player has to solve. Customisation is a desired feature in existing serious games as teachers often need to tailor this type of tools to their students. Pre- and post-surveys about air pollution were elaborated to evaluate air pollution perception of twenty students of an elementary school before and after playing the game, with results showing some significant positive effects. A System Usability Scale questionnaire was also performed and we obtained an acceptable mean value of 75, out of 100.","Serious game; Air pollution; Perception; Children; Educational","","","WOS","A serious game for raising air pollution perception in children Concerns about air pollution have increased recently.

To fill this research gap, this study examined the effect of numerical data through monitoring devices on the occupants' perception of IAQ. Therefore, an experiment was planned to evaluate the perceived IAQ based on a self-report questionnaire among ten subjects in an office environment. The experiment was divided into three sessions, with a classification model built for each session using automated machine learning and then derived variable importance for predictor variables. Results showed that when occupants did not check the numerical data of IAQ factors, they tended to perceive IAQ based on the perceived thermal comfort. In addition, occupants made a biased judgment of the current IAQ condition based on the past perceived IAQ checked 30 min ago. When occupants checked the numerical data of IAQ factors, they responded more sensitively to IAQ factors than to thermal environment factors when perceiving IAQ conditions.

Thus, this paper pays attention to residents' willingness to buy anti-haze cosmetics through customer perceived value theory. In this study, it is assumed that all consumers are rational economic people and that anti-haze cosmetics on the market can effectively cleanse, isolate and repair haze damage. Based on customer perceived value theory and the characteristic of anti-haze cosmetics, four main drivers and had been selected out, that is, monetary value, social value, brand value and perceived haze awareness. Then, based on 314 valid questionnaires, the structural equation analysis method had been used to analyze the impact of the four dimensions of customer perceived value theory on perceived value and consumers' purchase intention of anti-haze cosmetics. The empirical results showed that monetary value, social value, and perceived haze awareness had positive impact on perceived value and purchase intention of anti-haze cosmetics, while brand value only affects perceived value. Perceived value was a partial mediator between the relations of monetary value, social value, perceived haze awareness and purchase intention, while played a completely mediating role between brand value and purchase intention. Then, we also found that price sensitivity played a significant down-modulatory role in perceived value and purchase intention. Furthermore, the perceived haze awareness is the term that we first proposed in this realm, which extends and optimizes Customer Perceived Value. Finally, according to the survey results, consumers would be willing to pay an additional 56.1 yuan per month for the anti-haze effect of cosmetics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Public perceptions of air pollution are important for individual self-protection and policy-making. Given the uncertainty faced by residence-based exposure (RB) measurements, this study measures individuals’ real-time mobility-based (MB) exposures and perceptions of air pollution by considering people’s daily movement. It explores how contextual uncertainties may influence the disparities in perceived air quality by taking into account RB and MB environmental factors. In addition, we explore factors that are related to the mismatch between people’s perceived air quality and actual air pollution exposure. Using K-means clustering to divide the PM2.5 values into two groups, a mismatch happens when the perceived air quality is poor but the air pollution level is lower than 15.536μg/m3 and when the perceived air quality is good but the air pollution level is higher than 15.608μg/m3. The results show that there is a mismatch between air pollution exposure and perception of air pollution. People with low income are exposed to higher air pollution. Unemployed people and people with more serious mental health symptoms (e.g., depression) have a higher chance of accurately assessing air pollution (e.g., perceiving air quality as poor when air pollution levels are high). Older people and those with a higher MB open space density tend to underestimate air pollution. Students tend to perceive air quality as good. People who are surrounded by higher MB transportation land-use density and green space density tend to perceive air quality as poor.

Information on air pollution exposure (such as perception, symptoms, and risk management) contributes to the responsible promotion of bicycle commuting participation. Methods: To determine perceptions, symptoms, and willingness for specific exposure risk management strategies of exposure to air pollution, a questionnaire-based cross-sectional investigation was conducted with adult bicycle commuters (n = 153; age = 41 11 years; 28% female). Results: Frequency of acute respiratory signs and symptoms were positively associated with in-commute and postcommute compared with precommute time periods (P <.05); there was greater positive association with respiratory disorder compared with healthy, and female compared with male, participants. The perception (but not signs or symptoms) of in-commute exposure to air pollution was positively associated with the estimated level of in-commute proximity to motorized traffic. The majority of participants indicated a willingness (which varied with health status and gender) to adopt risk management strategies (with desired features) if shown to be appropriate and effective.

Methods: To determine perceptions, symptoms, and willingness for specific exposure risk management strategies of exposure to air pollution, a questionnaire-based cross-sectional investigation was conducted with adult bicycle commuters (n = 153; age = 41 11 years; 28% female). Results: Frequency of acute respiratory signs and symptoms were positively associated with in-commute and postcommute compared with precommute time periods (P <.05); there was greater positive association with respiratory disorder compared with healthy, and female compared with male, participants. The perception (but not signs or symptoms) of in-commute exposure to air pollution was positively associated with the estimated level of in-commute proximity to motorized traffic. The majority of participants indicated a willingness (which varied with health status and gender) to adopt risk management strategies (with desired features) if shown to be appropriate and effective. Conclusions: While acute signs and symptoms of air pollution exposure are indicated with bicycle commuting, and more so in susceptible individuals, there is willingness to manage exposure risk by adopting effective strategies with desired features. environment; physical activity; commute; public health; survey research Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Bicycling; Cities; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Male; Perception; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Risk Management; Surveys and Questionnaires; Transportation; air pollutant; adult; adverse effects; air pollutant; air pollution; city; cross-sectional study; cycling; environmental exposure; female; human; male; perception; questionnaire; Respiratory Tract Diseases; risk management; traffic and transport FINE PARTICULATE MATTER; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; HEALTH-BENEFITS; CARBON-MONOXIDE; LUNG-FUNCTION; TRANSPORT; ASSOCIATION; CHILDREN; QUALITY","```json

This study was conducted to determine the concentration of BTEX in the train and the platform of a railway service provider. Air sampling was conducted to compare the concentrations of BTEX in the train and platform by using activated charcoal sorbent tubes for one hour at Sentul- Klang route during peak hours. Analysis of air samples was done by using Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). In addition, questionnaires were distributed to 254 respondents by cluster sampling on weekdays to examine passengers' perception on the indoor air quality (IAQ) of trains and platforms. The results indicated that 70.5% of passengers are aged 21-30 years, 11.8% aged 31-40 years, 10.6% aged 51 years and over, 5.5% aged 41-50 years and 1.6% aged 20 years and less. Majority of the passengers perceived the density of passengers on trains as dense (63.0%) and platform as less dense (49.2%). Passengers mostly feel that ventilation (57.9%), wind quality (66.9%) and IAQ (57.9%) are acceptable in the train. In the platform, passengers mostly choose an acceptable answer to the perception of ventilation (64.6%), air quality (63.0%) and IAQ (70.5%). There were no significant differences in comparison of IAQ in the train and platform by passengers' age range (p>0.05). There is a significant correlation between IAQ and passenger density, ventilation, odor and air quality in the train (p<0.01). However, a significant correlation was only found between IAQ and ventilation and air quality in the platform (p<0.01) and no significant correlation was found between IAQ and the passenger density on the platform (p>0.01).

Passengers mostly feel that ventilation (57.9%), wind quality (66.9%) and IAQ (57.9%) are acceptable in the train. In the platform, passengers mostly choose an acceptable answer to the perception of ventilation (64.6%), air quality (63.0%) and IAQ (70.5%). There were no significant differences in comparison of IAQ in the train and platform by passengers' age range (p>0.05). There is a significant correlation between IAQ and passenger density, ventilation, odor and air quality in the train (p<0.01). However, a significant correlation was only found between IAQ and ventilation and air quality in the platform (p<0.01) and no significant correlation was found between IAQ and the passenger density on the platform (p>0.01). Although the overall passengers' perception of IAQ in the train and platform are acceptable, improvement is required especially regarding to indoor air quality services so that a better indoor environment can be achieved. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

In traditional exposure research, air pollution and noise are monitored with stationary measurement devices or based on models. During the last years, mobile measurement techniques with GPS-tracking have increased. Moreover, studies have investigated another dimension of personal exposure: the perceived exposure. Aim: Most of these studies make use of quantitative methods such as surveys, complemented by stationary or wearable sensors. Little research exist that applies qualitative methods to examine how people experience and perceive exposure on-the-move, contrasting it to actual measurements. The aim of this paper is to discuss the potential of a novel method, which extends the dimensions of personal exposure by including the situational context of exposure perception. Methods/case study: Firstly, different methods for exposure research are presented. Secondly, we introduce a novel mixed-method approach, exploring cyclists and pedestrians perceived and measured exposure on-the-move by combining mobile interviews (Go-/Ride-Alongs) and wearable sensors. We will present the methodological findings using a case study and have a quantitative method (smartphone questionnaire, wearable sensors) as a reference. Results and discussion: The differences of perceived and measured exposure, proven through the reference method, are a result of different situational contexts as shown by the mobile interviews (knowledge, embodied experience, life situation, activities). The methodological findings show, that mobile methods complemented by wearables introduce new dimensions of personal exposure: they shed light on the situational contexts that affect exposure perception during commute. Conclusion: We argue that both, perceived and measured exposure to air pollution and noise, need to be considered simultaneously. Complementing mobile interviews or surveys with wearable sensor data improves the understanding of urban dwellers requirements for healthier mobility. Potentials of these methods should be investigated further, both in research and for supporting urban transport planning decisions adapted to people's needs.","Mobile interview; Wearable sensors; Mixed-methods; Air pollution; Noise; Perception","atmospheric pollution; GPS; noise pollution; perception; pollution exposure; sensor; traffic emission; urban transport","PARTICULATE MATTER; WEARABLE SENSORS; HEALTH; PERCEPTION; EXPERIENCE; WALKING; CITY; NEIGHBORHOOD; INFORMATION; ANNOYANCE","WOS","Extending the dimensions of personal exposure assessment: A methodological discussion on perceived and measured noise and air pollution in traffic Background: The exposure to air pollution and noise is severely impacting people's health and is especially high alongside urban road- and rail-traffic.

Meanwhile, the ambient air pollution via particulate matter in such areas is closely related to the physical and mental health of the elderly visitors who suffer long-term exposure. This study is initiated to build a technological path between haze exposure and the elderly based on the positive and negative relationship between greenspace exposure and haze exposure under the background of the national strategy of healthy aging. In addition, the structured questionnaire interviews and the measured evidence-based experiments were conducted to collect data including physical environment data, crowd activity data, haze cognition data and basic population information. Combined with various statistical analyses including correlation analysis and mediating factor analysis, the impacts of haze in urban greenspaces on the decisions of the elderly to go out to visit such spaces as well as their physical and mental health were explored. A total of 138 crowd activity data and climate data were recorded, and 200 valid questionnaires were obtained. The results showed that the physical exercise and the social contact were two main reasons for the elderly to the greenspaces, and the typical activities of the elderly varied with the difference of physical environment using correlation and mediating effect analysis. Moreover, the air quality of six research sites reached or even be above moderate pollution (PM2.5 ≥115μg/ m3) during more than 70% of the survey period, suggesting that the air quality was worrying and exposed elderly visitors to serious health risks. According to questionnaire, the cognitive limitations on the potential hazards of haze were commonly existed in the elderly due to insufficient understanding of haze, vague perception and psychological neglect. In addition, the multiple and complex internal driving forces led to the decision-making of the elderly people to go to the greenspaces more perceptual than rational. Overall, there is no prominent correlation between PM2.5 concentration and crowd activities, showing that haze has little impact on the travel decision of the elderly since their insensitivity to haze pollution. There exists a gap between the cognitive decision of the elderly and the actual potential health hazards of haze.

However, little is known about the effect of personal exposure to either indoor or outdoor sources on the human perception of the IEQ. Here, we conducted a study to evaluate the association of human perception and health performance to exposure assessments by analyzing questionnaire survey obtained from 396 students and 64 parents. To test exposure conditions at different scenarios, schools and homes located in rural and urban areas were selected. We assessed the IEQ by measuring temperature, relative humidity, particulate matters, and CO2 level. Also, the effect of potential pollutant factors on the IEQ was evaluated at three different cases: vacuum cleaning, cooking, and air purifier operation. From the IEQ measurement, there was no difference in PM10 and airborne bacteria concentrations between urban and rural areas of both schools and homes. But, PM2.5 showed significant difference between the areas. CO2 levels in schools were correlated to the number of students. This study shows that health performance was strongly associated with people's perception of outdoor environmental quality. We found that perception can be considered a predictor of health performance as a health-related environmental marker. This study suggests the importance of reviewing public regulations regarding control of potential indoor pollutant sources, use of air purifiers and aspects indicative of satisfaction with indoor environmental exposure.","Indoor environmental quality; Human perception; Thermal comfort; PM concentration; Potential source; Health performance","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Environmental regulations; Exposure controls; Health; Rural areas; Surveys; Thermal comfort; Environmental exposure; Environmental quality; Human perception; Indoor and outdoor airs; Indoor environmental quality; Measuring temperature; Pm concentrations; Potential sources; aerosol; concentration (composition); environmental quality; health impact; health risk; indoor air; point source; questionnaire survey; relative humidity; rural area; temperature effect; urban area; Air cleaners","PARTICULATE MATTER; THERMAL COMFORT; AIRBORNE FUNGI; NATURAL VENTILATION; SCHOOLS; POLLUTANTS; BUILDINGS; DIOXIDE; NANOPARTICLES; ENVIRONMENTS","WOS","Personal exposure to indoor aerosols as actual concern: Perceived indoor and outdoor air quality, and health performances Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is known to affect personal health performances.

A questionnaire survey (MM-40-FIN) of work environment and possible symptoms among office workers was carried out. The measurements and the survey were conducted a few days before the duct cleaning and at least one month after the cleaning. Duct cleaning had no detectable effect on measured supply and indoor air quality. The average air flows exceeded 20 L/s per person before and after duct cleaning. The average amount of dust on the inner duct surfaces decreased significantly from 8.4 ± 9.1 g/m2 to 1.9 ± 2.1 g/m2. The viable microbial count on the inner duct surface on malt extract agar decreased about 70% and on dichloran glycerol agar 90%. TVOC concentration in supply air decreased about 31%, but this may have been caused by the changes in outdoor air TVOC concentrations. Settled dust on inner surfaces of ventilation systems did not significantly adsorb or desorb chemical compounds. The ventilation system acted as a source for some individual compounds and for some of them the source strength was even higher after the cleaning. However, the emissions of these VOCs were low.

To develop an effective strategy to reduce PM exposure, we performed detailed questionnaire surveys regarding the type of lifestyle required to avoid PM exposure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We correlated the data with real-time PM concentration during the winter season. Methods: We enrolled 104 patients with COPD aged 40 years or older. Detailed questionnaire surveys were conducted among participants, and internet of things-based sensors were installed at their homes to measure the indoor PM2.5 concentration, which was continuously monitored between December 2019 and February 2020. The associations among PM2.5 concentration, patients' lifestyles, and the impact of both concentration and lifestyle on COPD exacerbation were analyzed. Results: Mean outdoor PM2.5 concentration was higher than mean indoor PM2.5 concentration during the study period (21.28 +/- 5.09 mu g/m3 vs. 12.75 +/- 7.64 mu g/m3), with a mean difference of 8.53 +/- 7.99 mu g/m3. Among the various social factors and practices that aim to avoid exposure to PM, six practices and economic statuses were confirmed to reduce indoor PM2.5 concentration compared to outdoor concentration; Contrarily, these practices created a significant difference between the outdoor and indoor PM2.5 concentrations. The six practice items that showed a significant difference were 1) checking air quality forecast (the difference: -13.31 +/- 1.35 mu g/m3, p = 0.013), 2) indoor air filter operated (-15.43 +/- 1.32 mu g/m3, p 0.001), 3) ventilating home by opening the windows (-13.14 +/- 1.28 mu g/m3, p = 0.013), 4) checking filters of the air filter (-13.95 +/- 1.50 mu g/m3, p = 0.002), 5) refraining from going out when outside PM is high (-12.52 +/- 1.37 mu g/m3, p = 0.039), 6) wearing a mask when going out (-13.38 +/- 1.32 mu g/m3, p = 0.017). The higher the household income and economic level, the more significant the difference in the PM2.5 concentration. Severe exacerbation was more prevalent among patients with acute exacerbation as the exposure time of PM2.5 35 mu g/m3 or PM2.5>75 mu g/m3.

While much research has historically focused on outdoor air pollution, indoor air pollution has been relatively under-explored despite its strong connection with health outcomes, particularly respiratory health. Studies on air pollution exposure mitigation consistently reveal a significant knowledge gap between the understanding of air pollution as a health risk among lay individuals and expert scientists. This study aimed to assess how people define and understand the concept of ‘clean air’ within their home setting. Methods: We adopted a mixed-methods approach which used a guided questionnaire designed to elicit both quantitative and qualitative data, collected as digital voice notes. The total sample (n = 40) comprised data from two socially different sites of science and non-science events. We compared whether the notion of clean air inside homes differs between these two different social contexts and how views and ‘sense’ of indoor air pollution are formed. The concept of ‘place’ facilitated fluidity in our explorative analysis. Insights allowed us to assess the extent to which context mediates individuals’ perceptions of indoor air pollution and attitudes towards health risk. Results: We found that individuals’ insights were embodied in repetitive day-to-day activities (e.g. cleaning and cooking). Three key themes emerged (1) Stimulative Effects, (2) Contextual Conditions, and (3) Risk Attitudes. Sensory perceptions such as sight, smell and temperature primarily motivated participants to assess air quality inside their homes. These perceptions were shaped by contextual conditions, influencing how individuals perceived their health risk and were subsequently motivated to spend personal time considering or seeking information about household air pollution, or improving their home air quality. Conclusions: Our insights revealed that social, geographical, and contextual factors play a crucial role in individuals’ understandings of indoor air pollution. These dimensions should be integrated into designs of effective public health risk communication strategies.
